<h3><i>CRITIC ON THE HEARTH</i></h3>


<p><i>No one but myself knows what I have suffered, nor what my
books have gained, by your unsleeping watchfulness and admirable
pertinacity. And now here is a volume that goes into
the world and lacks your</i> imprimatur: <i>a strange thing in our
joint lives; and the reason of it stranger still! I have watched
with interest, with pain, and at length with amusement, your
unavailing attempts to peruse &ldquo;The Black Arrow&rdquo;; and I
think I should lack humour indeed, if I let the occasion slip and
did not place your name in the fly-leaf of the only book of mine
that you have never read&mdash;and never will read.</i></p>

<p><i>That others may display more constancy is still my hope.
The tale was written years ago for a particular audience and
(I may say) in rivalry with a particular author; I think I
should do well to name him&mdash;Mr. Alfred R. Phillips. It was
not without its reward at the time. I could not, indeed, displace
Mr. Phillips from his well-won priority; but in the eyes
of readers who thought less than nothing of &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Black Arrow&rdquo; was supposed to mark a clear advance.
Those who read volumes and those who read story papers belong
to different worlds. The verdict on &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo;
was reversed in the other court: I wonder, will it be the same
with its successor?</i></p>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<h5>JOHN AMEND-ALL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> a certain afternoon, in the late spring-time, the bell upon
Tunstall Moat House was heard ringing at an unaccustomed
hour. Far and near, in the forest and in the fields along the
river, people began to desert their labours and hurry towards
the sound; and in Tunstall hamlet a group of poor
country-folk stood wondering at the summons.</p>

<p>Tunstall hamlet at that period, in the reign of old King
Henry VI., wore much the same appearance as it wears to-day.
A score or so of houses, heavily framed with oak,
stood scattered in a long green valley ascending from the
river. At the foot, the road crossed a bridge, and mounting
on the other side, disappeared into the fringes of the forest
on its way to the Moat House, and further forth to Holywood
Abbey. Half-way up the village, the church stood
among yews. On every side the slopes were crowned and
the view bounded by the green elms and greening oak-trees
of the forest.</p>

<p>Hard by the bridge there was a stone cross upon a knoll,
and here the group had collected&mdash;half a dozen women and
one tall fellow in a russet smock&mdash;discussing what the bell
betided. An express had gone through the hamlet half an
hour before, and drunk a pot of ale in the saddle, not daring
to dismount for the hurry of his errand; but he had been
ignorant himself of what was forward, and only bore sealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
letters from Sir Daniel Brackley to Sir Oliver Oates, the
parson, who kept the Moat House in the master&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>But now there was the noise of a horse; and soon, out
of the edge of the wood and over the echoing bridge, there
rode up young Master Richard Shelton, Sir Daniel&rsquo;s ward.
He, at the least, would know, and they hailed him and
begged him to explain. He drew bridle willingly enough&mdash;a
young fellow not yet eighteen, sun-browned and grey-eyed,
in a jacket of deer&rsquo;s leather, with a black velvet collar,
a green hood upon his head, and a steel crossbow at his back.
The express, it appeared, had brought great news. A battle
was impending. Sir Daniel had sent for every man that
could draw a bow or carry a bill to go post-haste to Kettley,
under pain of his severe displeasure; but for whom they
were to fight, or of where the battle was expected, Dick
knew nothing. Sir Oliver would come shortly himself, and
Bennet Hatch was arming at that moment, for he it was who
should lead the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the ruin of this kind land,&rdquo; a woman said. &ldquo;If
the barons live at war, ploughfolk must eat roots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;every man that follows shall have
sixpence a day, and archers twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they live,&rdquo; returned the woman, &ldquo;that may very
well be; but how if they die, my master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cannot better die than for their natural lord,&rdquo;
said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No natural lord of mine,&rdquo; said the man in the smock.
&ldquo;I followed the Walsinghams; so we all did down Brierly
way, till two years ago come Candlemas. And now I must
side with Brackley! It was the law that did it; call ye
that natural? But now, what with Sir Daniel and what
with Sir Oliver&mdash;that knows more of law than honesty&mdash;I
have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt, God
bless him!&mdash;the poor innocent that cannot tell his right
hand from his left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak with an ill tongue, friend,&rdquo; answered Dick,
&ldquo;to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
same libel. But King Harry&mdash;praised be the saints!&mdash;has
come again into his right mind, and will have all things
peaceably ordained. And as for Sir Daniel, y&rsquo; are very
brave behind his back. But I will be no tale-bearer; and
let that suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say no harm of you, Master Richard,&rdquo; returned the
peasant. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are a lad; but when ye come to a man&rsquo;s
inches, ye will find ye have an empty pocket. I say no
more: the saints help Sir Daniel&rsquo;s neighbours, and the
Blessed Maid protect his wards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clipsby,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;you speak what I cannot hear
with honour. Sir Daniel is my good master, and my
guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now, will ye read me a riddle?&rdquo; returned
Clipsby. &ldquo;On whose side is Sir Daniel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Dick, colouring a little; for his
guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of
that period, and every change had brought him some increase
of fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned Clipsby, &ldquo;you, nor no man. For indeed,
he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron, and the
party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping&mdash;a
brown-faced, grizzled fellow, heavy of hand and grim of
mien, armed with sword and spear, a steel salet on his head,
a leather jack upon his body. He was a great man in these
parts; Sir Daniel&rsquo;s right hand in peace and war, and at that
time, by his master&rsquo;s interest, bailiff of the hundred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clipsby,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;off to the Moat House, and
send all other laggards the same gate. Bowyer will give
you jack and salet. We must ride before curfew. Look to
it: him that is last at the lych-gate Sir Daniel shall reward.
Look to it right well! I know you for a man of naught.&mdash;Nance,&rdquo;
he added, to one of the women, &ldquo;is old Appleyard
up town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;In his field,
for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
So the group dispersed, and while Clipsby walked
leisurely over the bridge, Bennet and young Shelton rode
up the road together, through the village and past the
church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see the old shrew,&rdquo; said Bennet. &ldquo;He will
waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift
than would serve a man to shoe a horse. And all because
he has been to the French wars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house to which they were bound was the last in the
village, standing alone among lilacs; and beyond it, on
three sides, there was open meadow rising towards the
borders of the wood.</p>

<p>Hatch dismounted, threw his rein over the fence, and
walked down the field, Dick keeping close at his elbow, to
where the old soldier was digging, knee-deep in his cabbages,
and now and again, in a cracked voice, singing a snatch of
song. He was all dressed in leather, only his hood and
tippet were of black frieze, and tied with scarlet; his face
was like a walnut-shell, both for colour and wrinkles; but
his old grey eye was still clear enough, and his sight unabated.
Perhaps he was deaf; perhaps he thought it unworthy of an
old archer of Agincourt to pay any heed to such disturbances;
but neither the surly notes of the alarm-bell, nor the
near approach of Bennet and the lad, appeared at all to
move him; and he continued obstinately digging, and piped
up, very thin and shaky:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick Appleyard,&rdquo; said Hatch, &ldquo;Sir Oliver commends
him to you, and bids that ye shall come within this hour to
the Moat House, there to take command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old fellow looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save you, my master!&rdquo; he said, grinning. &ldquo;And
where goeth Master Hatch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Hatch is off to Kettley, with every man that
we can horse,&rdquo; returned Bennet. &ldquo;There is a fight toward,
it seems, and my lord stays a reinforcement.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
&ldquo;Ay, verily,&rdquo; returned Appleyard. &ldquo;And what will ye
leave me to garrison withal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leave you six good men, and Sir Oliver to boot,&rdquo;
answered Hatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll not hold the place,&rdquo; said Appleyard; &ldquo;the
number sufficeth not. It would take two score to make it
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s for that we came to you, old shrew!&rdquo; replied
the other. &ldquo;Who else is there but you that could do aught
in such a house with such a garrison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! when the pinch comes, ye remember the old
shoe,&rdquo; returned Nick. &ldquo;There is not a man of you can
back a horse or hold a bill; and as for archery&mdash;St. Michael!
if old Harry the Fift were back again, he would stand and
let ye shoot at him for a farthing a shoot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Nick, there&rsquo;s some can draw a good bow yet,&rdquo;
said Bennet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw a good bow!&rdquo; cried Appleyard. &ldquo;Yes! But
who&rsquo;ll shoot me a good shoot? It&rsquo;s there the eye comes in,
and the head between your shoulders. Now, what might
you call a long shoot, Bennet Hatch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bennet, looking about him, &ldquo;it would be a
long shoot from here into the forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, it would be a longish shoot,&rdquo; said the old fellow,
turning to look over his shoulder; and then he put up his
hand over his eyes, and stood staring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you looking at?&rdquo; asked Bennet, with
a chuckle. &ldquo;Do you see Harry the Fift?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence.
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows; a few
white sheep wandered browsing; all was still but the distant
jangle of the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Appleyard?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the birds,&rdquo; said Appleyard.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, over the top of the forest, where it ran
down in a tongue among the meadows, and ended in a pair
of goodly green elms, about a bowshot from the field where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
they were standing, a flight of birds was skimming to and
fro, in evident disorder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of the birds?&rdquo; said Bennet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; returned Appleyard, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are a wise man to go
to war, Master Bennet. Birds are a good sentry; in forest
places they be the first line of battle. Look you, now, if we
lay here in camp, there might be archers skulking down
to get the wind of us; and here would you be, none the
wiser!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, old shrew,&rdquo; said Hatch, &ldquo;there be no men
nearer us than Sir Daniel&rsquo;s, at Kettley; y&rsquo; are as safe as in
London Tower; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few
chaffinches and sparrows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; grinned Appleyard. &ldquo;How many a
rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either
of us! St. Michael, man! they hate us like two pole-cats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sooth it is, they hate Sir Daniel,&rdquo; answered
Hatch, a little sobered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, they hate Sir Daniel, and they hate every man that
serves with him,&rdquo; said Appleyard; &ldquo;and in the first order
of hating, they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the
bowman. See ye here: if there was a stout fellow yonder
in the wood-edge, and you and I stood fair for him&mdash;as, by
St. George, we stand!&mdash;which, think ye, would he choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, for a good wager,&rdquo; answered Hatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My surcoat to a leather belt, it would be you!&rdquo; cried
the old archer. &ldquo;Ye burned Grimstone, Bennet&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
ne&rsquo;er forgive you that, my master. And as for me, I&rsquo;ll soon
be in a good place, God grant, and out of bow-shoot&mdash;ay,
and cannon-shoot&mdash;of all their malices. I am an old man,
and draw fast to homeward, where the bed is ready. But
for you, Bennet, y&rsquo; are to remain behind here at your own
peril, and if ye come to my years unhanged, the old true-blue
English spirit will be dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest,&rdquo;
returned Hatch, visibly ruffled by these threats. &ldquo;Get ye
to your arms before Sir Oliver come, and leave prating for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
one good while. An ye had talked so much with Harry the
Fift, his ears would ha&rsquo; been richer than his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An arrow sang in the air, like a huge hornet; it struck
old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades, and pierced
him clean through, and he fell forward on his face among
the cabbages. Hatch, with a broken cry, leapt into the air;
then, stooping double, he ran for the cover of the house.
And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a
lilac, and had his crossbow bent and shouldered, covering
the point of the forest.</p>

<p>Not a leaf stirred. The sheep were patiently browsing;
the birds had settled. But there lay the old man, with a
clothyard arrow standing in his back; and there were Hatch
holding to the gable, and Dick crouching and ready behind
the lilac bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see aught?&rdquo; cried Hatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a twig stirs,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think shame to leave him lying,&rdquo; said Bennet,
coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very
pale countenance. &ldquo;Keep a good eye on the wood, Master
Shelton&mdash;keep a clear eye on the wood. The saints assoil
us! here was a good shoot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bennet raised the old archer on his knee. He was not
yet dead; his face worked, and his eyes shut and opened
like machinery, and he had a most horrible, ugly look of
one in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can ye hear, old Nick?&rdquo; asked Hatch. &ldquo;Have ye a
last wish before ye wend, old brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pluck out the shaft, and let me pass, a&rsquo; Mary&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
gasped Appleyard, &ldquo;I be done with Old England. Pluck
it out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Dick,&rdquo; said Bennet, &ldquo;come hither, and pull me
a good pull upon the arrow. He would fain pass, the poor
sinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick laid down his crossbow, and pulling hard upon the
arrow, drew it forth. A gush of blood followed; the old
archer scrambled half upon his feet, called once upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
name of God, and then fell dead. Hatch, upon his knees
among the cabbages, prayed fervently for the welfare of the
passing spirit. But even as he prayed, it was plain that his
mind was still divided, and he kept ever an eye upon the
corner of the wood from which the shot had come. When
he had done, he got to his feet again, drew off one of his
mailed gauntlets, and wiped his pale face, which was all wet
with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be my turn next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who hath done this, Bennet?&rdquo; Richard asked, still
holding the arrow in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, the saints know,&rdquo; said Hatch. &ldquo;Here are a
good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of
house and holding, he and I. He has paid his shot, poor
shrew, nor will it be long, mayhap, ere I pay mine. Sir
Daniel driveth over-hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a strange shaft,&rdquo; said the lad, looking at the
arrow in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, by my faith!&rdquo; cried Bennet. &ldquo;Black, and black-feathered.
Here is an ill-favoured shaft, by my sooth! for
black, they say, bodes burial. And here be words written.
Wipe the blood away. What read ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Shelton.
&ldquo;What should this betoken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I like it not,&rdquo; returned the retainer, shaking his
head. &ldquo;John Amend-All! Here is a rogue&rsquo;s name for
those that be up in the world! But why stand we here to
make a mark? Take him by the knees, good Master Shelton,
while I lift him by the shoulders, and let us lay him in his
house. This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver; he will
turn paper-colour; he will pray like a windmill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took up the old archer, and carried him between
them into his house, where he had dwelt alone. And there
they laid him on the floor, out of regard for the mattress,
and sought, as best they might, to straighten and compose
his limbs.</p>

<p>Appleyard&rsquo;s house was clean and bare. There was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
bed, with a blue cover, a cupboard, a great chest, a pair of
joint-stools, a hinged table in the chimney-corner, and
hung upon the wall the old soldier&rsquo;s armoury of bows
and defensive armour. Hatch began to look about him
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick had money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He may have had three
score pounds put by. I would I could light upon&rsquo;t! When
ye lose an old friend, Master Richard, the best consolation
is to heir him. See, now, this chest. I would go a mighty
wager there is a bushel of gold therein. He had a strong
hand to get, and a hard hand to keep withal, had Appleyard
the archer. Now may God rest his spirit! Near eighty
year he was afoot and about, and ever getting; but now he&rsquo;s
on the broad of his back, poor shrew, and no more lacketh;
and if his chattels came to a good friend, he would be merrier,
methinks, in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Hatch,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;respect his stone-blind
eyes. Would ye rob the man before his body? Nay, he
would walk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hatch made several signs of the cross; but by this time
his natural complexion had returned, and he was not easily
to be dashed from any purpose. It would have gone hard
with the chest had not the gate sounded, and presently after
the door of the house opened and admitted a tall, portly,
ruddy, black-eyed man of near fifty, in a surplice and black
robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Appleyard,&rdquo; the newcomer was saying, as he entered,
but he stopped dead. &ldquo;Ave Maria!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Saints
be our shield! What cheer is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold cheer with Appleyard, sir parson,&rdquo; answered
Hatch, with perfect cheerfulness. &ldquo;Shot at his own door,
and alighteth even now at purgatory gates. Ay! there, if
tales be true, he shall lack neither coal nor candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool, and sat down
upon it, sick and white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a judgment! O, a great stroke!&rdquo; he sobbed,
and rattled off a leash of prayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Bennet,&rdquo; said the priest, somewhat recovering,
&ldquo;and what may this be? What enemy hath done this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Sir Oliver, is the arrow. See, it is written upon
with words,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the priest, &ldquo;this is a foul hearing! John
Amend-All! A right Lollardy word. And black of hue,
as for an omen! Sirs, this knave arrow likes me not. But
it importeth rather to take counsel. Who should this be?
Bethink you, Bennet. Of so many black ill-willers, which
should he be that doth so hardily outface us? Simnel? I
do much question it. The Walsinghams? Nay, they are
not yet so broken; they still think to have the law over us,
when times change. There was Simon Malmesbury, too.
How think ye, Bennet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What think ye, sir,&rdquo; returned Hatch, &ldquo;of Ellis Duckworth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Bennet, never. Nay, not he,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;There cometh never any rising, Bennet, from below&mdash;so
all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion; but rebellion
travelleth ever downward from above; and when
Dick, Tom, and Harry take them to their bills, look ever
narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby. Now,
Sir Daniel, having once more joined him to the Queen&rsquo;s
party, is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords. Thence,
Bennet, comes the blow&mdash;by what procuring, I yet seek;
but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please you, Sir Oliver,&rdquo; said Bennet, &ldquo;the axles
are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire.
So did this poor sinner, Appleyard. And, by your leave,
men&rsquo;s spirits are so foully inclined to all of us, that it needs
neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on. Hear my
plain thoughts: You, that are a clerk, and Sir Daniel, that
sails on any wind, ye have taken many men&rsquo;s goods, and
beaten and hanged not a few. Y&rsquo; are called to count for
this; in the end, I wot not how, ye have ever the uppermost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
at law, and ye think all patched. But give me leave, Sir
Oliver: the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is
but the angrier, and some day, when the black devil is by,
he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through
your inwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Bennet, y&rsquo; are in the wrong. Bennet, ye should
be glad to be corrected,&rdquo; said Sir Oliver. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are a prater,
Bennet, a talker, a babbler; your mouth is wider than your
two ears. Mend it, Bennet, mend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I say no more. Have it as ye list,&rdquo; said the retainer.</p>

<p>The priest now rose from the stool, and from the writing-case
that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper,
and a flint and steel. With these he sealed up the chest and
the cupboard with Sir Daniel&rsquo;s arms, Hatch looking on disconsolate;
and then the whole party proceeded, somewhat
timorously, to sally from the house and get to horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis time we were on the road, Sir Oliver,&rdquo; said Hatch,
as he held the priest&rsquo;s stirrup while he mounted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay; but, Bennet, things are changed,&rdquo; returned the
parson. &ldquo;There is now no Appleyard&mdash;rest his soul!&mdash;to
keep the garrison. I shall keep you, Bennet. I must
have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows.
&lsquo;The arrow that flieth by day,&rsquo; saith the evangel; I have
no mind of the context; nay, I am a sluggard priest, I am
too deep in men&rsquo;s affairs. Well, let us ride forth, Master
Hatch. The jackmen should be at the church by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they rode forward down the road, with the wind after
them, blowing the tails of the parson&rsquo;s cloak; and behind
them, as they went, clouds began to arise and blot out the
sinking sun. They had passed three of the scattered houses
that make up Tunstall hamlet, when, coming to a turn,
they saw the church before them. Ten or a dozen houses
clustered immediately round it; but to the back the churchyard
was next the meadows. At the lych-gate, near a score
of men were gathered, some in the saddle, some standing
by their horses&rsquo; heads. They were variously armed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
mounted; some with spears, some with bills, some with
bows, and some bestriding plough-horses, still splashed with
the mire of the furrow; for these were the very dregs of the
country, and all the better men and the fair equipments were
already with Sir Daniel in the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not done amiss, praised be the cross of Holywood!
Sir Daniel will be right well content,&rdquo; observed the
priest, inwardly numbering the troop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes? Stand! if ye be true!&rdquo; shouted Bennet.</p>

<p>A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among
the yews; and at the sound of this summons he discarded
all concealment, and fairly took to his heels for the forest.
The men at the gate, who had been hitherto unaware of the
stranger&rsquo;s presence, woke and scattered. Those who had
dismounted began scrambling into the saddle: the rest rode
in pursuit; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated
ground, and it was plain their quarry would escape
them. Hatch, roaring an oath, put his horse at the hedge,
to head him off; but the beast refused, and sent his rider
sprawling in the dust. And though he was up again in a
moment, and had caught the bridle, the time had gone by,
and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of
capture.</p>

<p>The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton. Instead of
starting in a vain pursuit, he had whipped his crossbow from
his back, bent it, and set a quarrel to the string; and now,
when the others had desisted, he turned to Bennet, and
asked if he should shoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot! shoot!&rdquo; cried the priest, with sanguinary
violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cover him, Master Dick,&rdquo; said Bennet. &ldquo;Bring me
him down like a ripe apple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety;
but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill,
and the man ran slower in proportion. What with the
greyness of the falling night, and the uneven movements of
the runner, it was no easy aim; and as Dick levelled his bow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
he felt a kind of pity, and a half desire that he might miss.
The quarrel sped.</p>

<p>The man stumbled and fell, and a great cheer arose from
Hatch and the pursuers. But they were counting their
corn before the harvest. The man fell lightly; he was
lightly afoot again, turned and waved his cap in a bravado,
and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the
wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the plague go with him!&rdquo; cried Bennet. &ldquo;He
has thieves&rsquo; heels: he can run, by St. Banbury! But you
touched him, Master Shelton; he has stolen your quarrel,
may he never have good I grudge him less!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but what made he by the church?&rdquo; asked Sir
Oliver. &ldquo;I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief
here.&mdash;Clipsby, good fellow, get ye down from your horse,
and search thoroughly among the yews.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned, carrying
a paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This writing was pinned to the church door,&rdquo; he said,
handing it to the parson. &ldquo;I found-naught else, sir parson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, by the power of Mother Church,&rdquo; cried Sir Oliver,
&ldquo;but this runs hard on sacrilege! For the king&rsquo;s good
pleasure, or the lord of the manor&mdash;well! But that every
run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the
chancel door&mdash;nay, it runs hard on sacrilege, hard; and men
have burned for matters of less weight! But what have we
here? The light fails apace. Good Master Richard, y&rsquo;
have young eyes. Read me, I pray, this libel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud.
It contained some lines of a very rugged doggerel, hardly
even rhyming, written in a gross character, and most uncouthly
spelt. With the spelling somewhat bettered, this
is how they ran:&mdash;</p>

<p class="f90">&ldquo;Item, we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres
of your following.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pt2">&ldquo;Now, well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces!&rdquo;
cried Sir Oliver lamentably. &ldquo;Sirs, this is an ill world,
and groweth daily worse. I will swear upon the cross of
Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight&rsquo;s hurt,
whether in act or purpose, as the babe unchristened.
Neither was his throat cut; for therein they are again in
error, as there still live credible witnesses to show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It boots not, sir parson,&rdquo; said Bennet. &ldquo;Here is unseasonable
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Master Bennet, not so. Keep ye in your due
place, good Bennet,&rdquo; answered the priest. &ldquo;I shall make
mine innocence appear. I will upon no consideration lose
my poor life in error. I take all men to witness that I am
clear of this matter. I was not even in the Moat House.
I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Oliver,&rdquo; said Hatch, interrupting, &ldquo;since it please
you not to stop this sermon, I will take other means.&mdash;Goffe,
sound to horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while the tucket was sounding, Bennet moved close
to the bewildered parson, and whispered violently in his ear.</p>

<p>Dick Shelton saw the priest&rsquo;s eye turned upon him for
an instant in a startled glance. He had some cause for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
thought; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural
father. But he said never a word, and kept his countenance
unmoved.</p>

<p>Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their
altered situation; ten men, it was decided between them,
should be reserved, not only to garrison the Moat House,
but to escort the priest across the wood. In the meantime,
as Bennet was to remain behind, the command of the reinforcement
was given to Master Shelton. Indeed, there was
no choice; the men were loutish fellows, dull and unskilled
in war, while Dick was not only popular, but resolute and
grave beyond his age. Although his youth had been spent
in these rough country places, the lad had been well taught
in letters by Sir Oliver, and Hatch himself had shown him
the management of arms and the first principles of command.
Bennet had always been kind and helpful; he was
one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call
their enemies, but ruggedly faithful and well-willing to their
friends; and now, while Sir Oliver entered the next house
to write, in his swift, exquisite penmanship, a memorandum
of the last occurrences to his master, Sir Daniel Brackley,
Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his
enterprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye must go the long way about, Master Shelton,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;round by the bridge, for your life!  Keep a sure
man, fifty paces afore you, to draw shots; and go softly till
y&rsquo; are past the wood. If the rogues fall upon you, ride for
&rsquo;t; ye will do naught by standing. And keep ever forward,
Master Shelton; turn me not back again, an ye love your
life; there is no help in Tunstall, mind ye that. And now,
since ye go to the great wars about the king, and I continue
to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life, and the saints
alone can certify if we shall meet again below, I give you my
last counsels now at your riding. Keep an eye on Sir
Daniel; he is unsure. Put not your trust in the jack-priest;
he intendeth not amiss, but doth the will of others; it is a
hand-gun for Sir Daniel! Get you good lordship where ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
go; make you strong friends; look to it. And think ever a
paternoster-while on Bennet Hatch. There are worse
rogues afoot than Bennet. So, God-speed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Heaven be with you, Bennet!&rdquo; returned Dick.
&ldquo;Ye were a good friend to me-ward, and so I shall say
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look ye, master,&rdquo; added Hatch, with a certain
embarrassment, &ldquo;if this Amend-All should get a shaft into
me, ye might, mayhap, lay out a gold mark or mayhap a
pound for my poor soul; for it is like to go stiff with me in
purgatory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye shall have your will of it, Bennet,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;But, what cheer, man! we shall meet again, where ye
shall have more need of ale than masses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saints so grant it, Master Dick!&rdquo; returned the
other. &ldquo;But here comes Sir Oliver. An he were as quick
with the long-bow as with the pen, he would be a brave
man-at-arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver gave Dick a sealed packet, with this superscription:
&ldquo;To my ryght worchypful master, Sir Daniel
Brackley, knyght, be thys delyvered in haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dick, putting it in the bosom of his jacket, gave the
word and set forth westward up the village.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>AT THE SIGN OF THE &ldquo;SUN&rdquo; IN KETTLEY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Sir Daniel</span> and his men lay in and about Kettley that night,
warmly quartered and well patrolled. But the Knight of
Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting;
and even now, when he was on the brink of an adventure
which should make or mar him, he was up an hour after
midnight to squeeze poor neighbours. He was one who
trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances; it was his way
to buy out the most unlikely claimant, and then, by the
favour he curried with great lords about the king, procure
unjust decisions in his favour; or, if that was too round-about,
to seize the disputed manor by force of arms, and
rely on his influence and Sir Oliver&rsquo;s cunning in the law to
hold what he had snatched. Kettley was one such place;
it had come very lately into his clutches; he still met with
opposition from the tenants; and it was to overawe discontent
that he had led his troops that way.</p>

<p>By two in the morning, Sir Daniel sat in the inn room,
close by the fireside, for it was cold at that hour among the
fens of Kettley. By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale.
He had taken off his visored headpiece, and sat with his bald
head and thin dark visage resting on one hand, wrapped
warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak. At the lower end of
the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the
door or lay asleep on benches; and, somewhat nearer hand,
a young lad apparently of twelve or thirteen was stretched
in a mantle on the floor. The host of the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; stood
before the great man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, mark me, mine host,&rdquo; Sir Daniel said, &ldquo;follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
but mine orders, and I shall be your good lord ever. I must
have good men for head boroughs, and I will have Adam-a-More
high constable; see to it narrowly. If other men be
chosen, it shall avail you nothing; rather it shall be found
to your sore cost. For those that have paid rent to Walsingham
I shall take good measure&mdash;you among the rest,
mine host.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good knight,&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;I will swear upon the
cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion.
Nay, bully knight, I love not the rogue Walsinghams;
they were as poor as thieves, bully knight. Give me
a great lord like you. Nay; ask me among the neighbours,
I am stout for Brackley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel drily. &ldquo;Ye shall then pay
twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The innkeeper made a horrid grimace; but this was a piece
of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly
times, and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring up yon fellow, Selden!&rdquo; cried the knight.</p>

<p>And one of his retainers led up a poor, cringing old man,
as pale as a candle, and all shaking with the fen fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirrah,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel, &ldquo;your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please your worship,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;my
name is Condall&mdash;Condall of Shoreby, at your good worship&rsquo;s
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard you ill reported on,&rdquo; returned the knight.
&ldquo;Ye deal in treason, rogue; ye trudge the country leasing;
y&rsquo; are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals. How,
fellow, are ye so bold? But I will bring you down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right honourable and my reverend lord,&rdquo; the man
cried, &ldquo;here is some hodge-podge, saving your good presence.
I am but a poor private man, and have hurt none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely,&rdquo; said
the knight. &ldquo;&rsquo;Seize me,&rsquo; saith he, &lsquo;that Tyndal of
Shoreby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Condall, my good lord; Condall is my poor name,&rdquo;
said the unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
&ldquo;Condall or Tyndal, it is all one,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel
coolly. &ldquo;For, by my sooth,  y&rsquo; are here, and I do mightily
suspect your honesty. If you would save your neck, write
me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For twenty pound, my good lord!&rdquo; cried Condall.
&ldquo;Here is midsummer madness! My whole estate amounteth
not to seventy shillings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Condall or Tyndal,&rdquo; returned Sir Daniel, grinning,
&ldquo;I will run my peril of that loss. Write me down twenty,
and when I have recovered all I may, I will be good lord to
you, and pardon you the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my good lord, it may not be; I have no skill to
write,&rdquo; said Condall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-a-day!&rdquo; returned the knight. &ldquo;Here, then, is
no remedy. Yet I would fain have spared you, Tyndal,
had my conscience suffered.&mdash;Selden, take me this old
shrew softly to the nearest elm, and hang me him tenderly
by the neck, where I may see him at my riding. Fare ye
well, good Master Condall, dear Master Tyndal; y&rsquo; are post-haste
for Paradise; fare ye then well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my right pleasant lord,&rdquo; replied Condall, forcing
an obsequious smile, &ldquo;an ye be so masterful, as doth right
well become you, I will even, with all my poor skill, do your
good bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; quoth Sir Daniel, &ldquo;ye will now write two
score. Go to! y&rsquo; are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy
shillings. Selden, see him write me this in good form, and
have it duly witnessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Sir Daniel, who was a very merry knight, none
merrier in England, took a drink of his mulled ale, and lay
back, smiling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boy upon the floor began to stir, and
presently sat up and looked about him with a scare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hither,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel; and as the other rose at his
command and came slowly towards him, he leaned back and
laughed outright. &ldquo;By the rood!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a sturdy
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
The lad flashed crimson with anger, and darted a look
of hate out of his dark eyes. Now that he was on his legs,
it was more difficult to make certain of his age. His face
looked somewhat older in expression, but it was as smooth
as a young child&rsquo;s; and in bone and body he was unusually
slender, and somewhat awkward of gait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have called me, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Was it to
laugh at my poor plight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, let laugh,&rdquo; said the knight. &ldquo;Good shrew,
let laugh, I pray you. An ye could see yourself, I warrant
ye would laugh the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried the lad, flushing, &ldquo;ye shall answer this
when ye answer for the other. Laugh while yet ye may!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, good cousin,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel, with some
earnestness, &ldquo;think not that I mock at you, except in mirth,
as between kinsfolk and singular friends. I will make you
a marriage of a thousand pounds, go to! and cherish you
exceedingly. I took you, indeed, roughly, as the time demanded;
but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain
and cheerfully serve you. Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton&mdash;Lady
Shelton, by my troth! for the lad promiseth bravely.
Tut! ye will not shy for honest laughter; it purgeth melancholy.
They are no rogues who laugh, good cousin.&mdash;Good
mine host, lay me a meal now for my cousin, Master
John.&mdash;Sit ye down, sweetheart, and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Master John, &ldquo;I will break no bread.
Since ye force me to this sin, I will fast for my soul&rsquo;s interest.&mdash;But,
good mine host, I pray you of courtesy give me a cup
of fair water; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye shall have a dispensation, go to!&rdquo; cried the knight.
&ldquo;Shalt be well shriven, by my faith! Content you, then,
and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the lad was obstinate, drank a cup of water, and,
once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle, sat in a
far corner, brooding.</p>

<p>In an hour or two there rose a stir in the village of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses;
and then a troop drew up by the inn-door, and Richard
Shelton, splashed with mud, presented himself upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save you, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How! Dickie Shelton!&rdquo; cried the knight; and at the
mention of Dick&rsquo;s name the other lad looked curiously
across. &ldquo;What maketh Bennet Hatch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please you, sir knight, to take cognisance of this packet
from Sir Oliver, wherein are all things fully stated,&rdquo;
answered Richard, presenting the priest&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;And
please you farther, ye were best make all speed to Risingham;
for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously
with letters, and by his report, my Lord of Risingham
was sore bestead, and lacked exceedingly your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How say you? Sore bestead?&rdquo; returned the knight.
&ldquo;Nay, then, we will make speed sitting down, good Richard.
As the world goes in this poor realm of England, he that
rides softliest rides surest. Delay, they say, begetteth
peril; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men;
mark it, Dick. But let me see, first, what cattle ye have
brought.&mdash;Selden, a link here at the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street, and,
by the red glow of a torch, inspected his new troops. He
was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master;
but as a leader in war he was well beloved by those who
rode behind his pennant. His dash, his proved courage,
his forethought for the soldiers&rsquo; comfort, even his rough
gibes, were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and
salet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, by the rood!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what poor dogs are
these? Here be some as crooked as a bow, and some as
lean as a spear. Friends, ye shall ride in the front of the
battle; I can spare you, friends. Mark me this old villain
on the piebald! A two-year mutton riding on a hog would
look more soldierly! Ha! Clipsby, are ye there, old rat?
Y&rsquo; are a man I could lose with a good heart; ye shall go in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
front of all, with a bull&rsquo;s-eye painted on your jack, to be the
better butt for archery; sirrah, ye shall show me the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show you any way, Sir Daniel, but the way to
change sides,&rdquo; returned Clipsby sturdily.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, well said!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Hast a shrewd tongue
in thy mouth, go to! I will forgive you for that merry
word.&mdash;Selden, see them fed, both man and brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight re-entered the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, friend Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fall to. Here is good ale
and bacon. Eat while that I read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Daniel opened the packet, and as he read his brow
darkened. When he had done he sat a little, musing.
Then he looked sharply at his ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have seen this penny rhyme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It bears your father&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; continued the knight;
&ldquo;and our poor shrew of a parson is, by some mad soul,
accused of slaying him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did most eagerly deny it,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; cried the knight, very sharply. &ldquo;Heed
him not. He has a loose tongue; he babbles like a jack-sparrow.
Some day, when I may find the leisure, Dick, I
will myself more fully inform you of these matters. There
was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it; but the times
were troubled, and there was no justice to be got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It befell at the Moat House?&rdquo; Dick ventured, with a
beating at his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It befell between the Moat House and Holywood,&rdquo;
replied Sir Daniel calmly; but he shot a covert glance,
black with suspicion, at Dick&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added
the knight, &ldquo;speed you with your meal; ye shall return to
Tunstall with a line from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s face fell sorely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prithee, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;send one of the
villains! I beseech you let me to the battle. I can strike
a stroke, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
&ldquo;I misdoubt it not,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel, sitting down to
write. &ldquo;But here, Dick, is no honour to be won. I lie in
Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war, and then ride to
join me with the conqueror. Cry not on cowardice; it is
but wisdom, Dick; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion,
and the king&rsquo;s name and custody so changeth hands,
that no man may be certain of the morrow. Toss-pot and
Shuttle-wit run in, but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o&rsquo; one
side, waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Sir Daniel, turning his back to Dick, and
quite at the farther end of the long table, began to write his
letter, with his mouth on one side, for this business of the
Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, young Shelton was going on heartily enough
with his breakfast, when he felt a touch upon his arm, and
a very soft voice whispering in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make not a sign, I do beseech you,&rdquo; said the voice,
&ldquo;but of your charity teach me the straight way to Holywood.
Beseech you, now, good boy, comfort a poor soul
in peril and extreme distress, and set me so far forth upon
the way to my repose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the path by the windmill,&rdquo; answered Dick, in
the same tone; &ldquo;it will bring you to Till Ferry; there
inquire again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And without turning his head, he fell again to eating.
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young
lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; thought Dick, &ldquo;he is as young as I. &lsquo;Good
boy&rsquo; doth he call me? An I had known, I should have seen
the varlet hanged ere I had told him. Well, if he goes
through the fen, I may come up with him and pull his ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter and
bade him speed to the Moat House. And again, some half
an hour after Dick&rsquo;s departure, a messenger came, in hot
haste, from my Lord of Risingham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel,&rdquo; the messenger said, &ldquo;ye lose great honour,
by my sooth! The fight began again this morning ere the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
dawn, and we have beaten their van and scattered their
right wing. Only the main battle standeth fast. An we
had your fresh men, we should tilt you them all into the
river. What, sir knight! Will ye be the last? It stands
not with your good credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the knight, &ldquo;I was but now upon the
march.&mdash;Selden, sound me the tucket.&mdash;Sir, I am with you
on the instant. It is not two hours since the more part of
my command came in, sir messenger. What would ye
have? Spurring is good meat, but yet it killed the charger.&mdash;Bustle,
boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the
morning, and from all sides Sir Daniel&rsquo;s men poured into
the main street and formed before the inn. They had slept
upon their arms, with chargers saddled, and in ten minutes
five score men-at-arms and archers, cleanly equipped and
briskly disciplined, stood ranked and ready. The chief part
were in Sir Daniel&rsquo;s livery, murrey and blue, which gave the
greater show to their array. The best armed rode first;
and away out of sight, at the tail of the column, came the
sorry reinforcement of the night before. Sir Daniel looked
with pride along the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are pretty men, indeed,&rdquo; replied the messenger.
&ldquo;It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the
earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;what would ye? The beginning
of a feast and the end of a fray, sir messenger&rdquo;;
and he mounted into his saddle. &ldquo;Why! how now!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;John! Joanna! Nay, by the sacred rood!
where is she?&mdash;Host, where is that girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl, Sir Daniel?&rdquo; cried the landlord. &ldquo;Nay, sir, I
saw no girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, then, dotard!&rdquo; cried the knight. &ldquo;Could ye
not see it was a wench? She in the murrey-coloured
mantle&mdash;she that broke her fast with water, rogue&mdash;where
is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
&ldquo;Nay, the saints bless us! Master John, ye called him,&rdquo;
said the host. &ldquo;Well, I thought none evil. He is gone.
I saw him&mdash;her&mdash;I saw her in the stable a good hour agone;
&rsquo;a was saddling a grey horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, by the rood!&rdquo; cried Sir Daniel, &ldquo;the wench was
worth five hundred pound to me and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir knight,&rdquo; observed the messenger, with bitterness,
&ldquo;while that ye are here, roaring for five hundred pounds,
the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well said,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel.&mdash;&ldquo;Selden, fall me
out with six crossbowmen; hunt me her down. I care not
what it cost; but, at my returning, let me find her at the
Moat House. Be it upon your head.&mdash;And now, sir
messenger, we march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the troops broke into a good trot, and Selden and
his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley, with
the staring villagers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>IN THE FEN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was near six in the May morning when Dick began to
ride down into the fen upon his homeward way. The sky
was all blue; the jolly wind blew loud and steady; the
windmill-sails were spinning; and the willows over all the
fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn. He had been
all night in the saddle, but his heart was good and his body
sound, and he rode right merrily.</p>

<p>The path went down and down into the marsh, till he
lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks, but Kettley
windmill on the knoll behind him, and the extreme top of
Tunstall Forest far before. On either hand there were great
fields of blowing reeds and willows, pools of water shaking
in the wind, and treacherous bogs, as green as emerald, to
tempt and to betray the traveller. The path lay almost
straight through the morass. It was already very ancient;
its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery; in the
lapse of ages much of it had sunk, and every here and there,
for a few hundred yards, it lay submerged below the stagnant
waters of the fen.</p>

<p>About a mile from Kettley, Dick came to one such
break in the plain line of causeway, where the reeds and
willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the
eye. The gap, besides, was more than usually long; it was
a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief;
and Dick bethought him, with something like a pang, of the
lad whom he had so imperfectly directed. As for himself,
one look backward to where the windmill-sails were turning
black against the blue of heaven&mdash;one look forward to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
high ground of Tunstall Forest, and he was sufficiently
directed, and held straight on, the water washing to his
horse&rsquo;s knees, as safe as on a highway.</p>

<p>Half-way across, and when he had already sighted the
path rising high and dry upon the farther side, he was aware
of a great splashing on his right, and saw a grey horse, sunk
to its belly in the mud, and still spasmodically struggling.
Instantly, as though it had divined the neighbourhood of
help, the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly. It
rolled, meanwhile, a bloodshot eye, insane with terror; and
as it sprawled wallowing in the quag, clouds of stinging
insects rose and buzzed about it in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; thought Dick, &ldquo;can the poor lad have
perished? There is his horse, for certain&mdash;a brave grey!
Nay, comrade, if thou criest to me so piteously, I will do all
man can to help thee. Shalt not lie there to drown by
inches!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he made ready his crossbow, and put a quarrel
through the creature&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy, somewhat
sobered in spirit, and looking closely about him for any sign
of his less happy predecessor in the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would I had dared to tell him further,&rdquo; he thought;
&ldquo;for I fear he has miscarried in the slough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just as he was so thinking, a voice cried upon
his name from the causeway side, and looking over his
shoulder, he saw the lad&rsquo;s face peering from a clump of
reeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye there?&rdquo; he said, reining in. &ldquo;Ye lay so close
among the reeds that I had passed you by. I saw your
horse bemired, and put him from his agony! which, by my
sooth! an ye had been a more merciful rider, ye had done
yourself. But come forth out of your hiding. Here be
none to trouble you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, good boy, I have no arms, nor skill to use them
if I had,&rdquo; replied the other, stepping forth upon the pathway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
&ldquo;Why call me &lsquo;boy&rsquo;?&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are not, I
trow, the elder of us twain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Master Shelton,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;prithee forgive
me. I have none the least intention to offend. Rather
I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour,
for I am now worse bestead than ever, having lost my way,
my cloak, and my poor horse. To have a riding-rod and
spurs, and never a horse to sit upon! And before all,&rdquo; he
added, looking ruefully upon his clothes&mdash;&ldquo;before all, to be
so sorrily besmirched!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Would ye mind a ducking?
Blood of wound or dust of travel&mdash;that&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s adornment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, I like him better plain,&rdquo; observed the lad.
&ldquo;But, prithee, how shall I do? Prithee, good Master
Richard, help me with your good counsel. If I come not
safe to Holywood, I am undone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick, dismounting, &ldquo;I will give more than
counsel. Take my horse, and I will run awhile, and when
I am weary we shall change again, that so, riding and
running, both may go the speedier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the change was made, and they went forward as
briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway, Dick with his
hand upon the other&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How call ye your name?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me John Matcham,&rdquo; replied the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what make ye to Holywood?&rdquo; Dick continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong
pillar to the weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how came ye with Sir Daniel, Master Matcham?&rdquo;
pursued Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;by the abuse of force! He
hath taken me by violence from my own place; dressed me
in these weeds; ridden with me till my heart was sick;
gibed me till I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; wept; and when certain of my
friends pursued, thinking to have me back, claps me in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
rear to stand their shot! I was even grazed in the right
foot, and walk but lamely. Nay, there shall come a day
between us; he shall smart for all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun?&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a valiant knight, and hath a hand of iron.
An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight, it
would go sore with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, poor boy,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are his ward,
I know it. By the same token, so am I, or so he saith; or
else he hath bought my marriage&mdash;I wot not rightly which;
but it is some handle to oppress me by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy again!&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, shall I call you girl, good Richard?&rdquo; asked
Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a girl for me,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;I do abjure the
crew of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak boyishly,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Ye think more
of them than ye pretend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Dick stoutly. &ldquo;They come not in my
mind. A plague of them, say I! Give me to hunt and to
fight and to feast, and to live with jolly foresters. I never
heard of a maid yet that was for any service, save one only;
and she, poor shrew, was burned for a witch and the wearing
of men&rsquo;s clothes in spite of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour, and
appeared to pray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What make ye?&rdquo; Dick inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray for her spirit,&rdquo; answered the other, with a somewhat
troubled voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a witch&rsquo;s spirit?&rdquo; Dick cried. &ldquo;But pray for her
and ye list; she was the best wench in Europe, was this
Joan of Arc. Old Appleyard the archer ran from her, he
said, as if she had been Mahoun. Nay, she was a brave
wench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but, good Master Richard,&rdquo; resumed Matcham,
&ldquo;an ye like maids so little, y&rsquo; are no true natural man; for
God made them twain by intention, and brought true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
love into the world, to be man&rsquo;s hope and woman&rsquo;s
comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are a milk-sopping baby,
so to harp on women. An ye think I be no true man, get
down upon the path, and whether at fists, backsword, or
bow and arrow, I will prove my manhood on your body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am no fighter,&rdquo; replied Matcham eagerly. &ldquo;I
mean no tittle of offence. I meant but pleasantry. And if
I talk of women, it is because I heard ye were to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I to marry!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, it is the first
I hear of it. And with whom was I to marry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Joan Sedley,&rdquo; replied Matcham, colouring. &ldquo;It
was Sir Daniel&rsquo;s doing; he hath money to gain upon both
sides; and, indeed, I have heard the poor wench bemoaning
herself pitifully of the match. It seems she is of your mind,
or else distasted to the bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! marriage is like death, it comes to all,&rdquo; said
Dick, with resignation. &ldquo;And she bemoaned herself? I
pray ye now, see there how shuttle-witted are these girls:
to bemoan herself before that she had seen me! Do I bemoan
myself? Not I. An I be to marry, I will marry dry-eyed!
But if ye know her, prithee, of what favour is she?
fair or foul? And is she shrewish or pleasant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, what matters it?&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;An y&rsquo; are
to marry, ye can but marry. What matters foul or fair?
These be but toys. Y&rsquo; are no milksop, Master Richard;
ye will wed with dry eyes anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well said,&rdquo; replied Shelton. &ldquo;Little I reck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord,&rdquo; said
Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall have the lord Heaven made for her,&rdquo; returned
Dick. &ldquo;I trow there be worse as well as better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the poor wench!&rdquo; cried the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why so poor?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To wed a man of wood,&rdquo; replied his companion. &ldquo;O
me, for a wooden husband!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I be a man of wood, indeed,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
trudge afoot the while you ride my horse; but it is good
wood, I trow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Dick, forgive me,&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;Nay, y&rsquo;
are the best heart in England; I but laughed. Forgive me
now, sweet Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, no fool words,&rdquo; returned Dick, a little embarrassed
by his companion&rsquo;s warmth. &ldquo;No harm is done. I
am not touchy, praise the saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that moment the wind, which was blowing
straight behind them as they went, brought them the rough
flourish of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s trumpeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;the tucket soundeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;they have found my flight, and
now I am unhorsed!&rdquo; and he became pale as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, what cheer!&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; have a long
start, and we are near the ferry. And it is I, methinks,
that am unhorsed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alack, I shall be taken!&rdquo; cried the fugitive. &ldquo;Dick,
kind Dick, beseech ye help me but a little!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, now, what aileth thee?&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Methinks
I help you very patently. But my heart is sorry for so
spiritless a fellow! And see ye here, John Matcham&mdash;sith
John Matcham is your name&mdash;I, Richard Shelton, tide what
betideth, come what may, will see you safe in Holywood.
The saints so do to me again if I default you. Come, pick
me up a good heart, Sir White-face. The way betters here;
spur me the horse. Go faster! faster! Nay, mind not for
me; I can run like a deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, with the horse trotting hard, and Dick running easily
alongside, they crossed the remainder of the fen, and came
out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman&rsquo;s hut.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE FEN FERRY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> river Till was a wide, sluggish, clayey water, oozing out
of fens, and in this part of its course it strained among some
score of willow-covered, marshy islets.</p>

<p>It was a dingy stream; but upon this bright, spirited
morning everything was become beautiful. The wind and
the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples; and the
reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in
crumbs of smiling blue.</p>

<p>A creek ran up to meet the path, and close under the
bank the ferryman&rsquo;s hut lay snugly. It was of wattle and
clay, and the grass grew green upon the roof.</p>

<p>Dick went to the door and opened it. Within, upon a
foul old russet cloak, the ferryman lay stretched and shivering;
a great hulk of a man, but lean and shaken by the
country fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Master Shelton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be ye for the ferry?
Ill times, ill times! Look to yourself. There is a fellowship
abroad. Ye were better turn round on your two heels
and try the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay; time&rsquo;s in the saddle,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Time
will ride, Hugh Ferryman. I am hot in haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wilful man!&rdquo; returned the ferryman, rising. &ldquo;An
ye win safe to the Moat House, y&rsquo; have done lucky; but I
say no more.&rdquo; And then catching sight of Matcham,
&ldquo;Who be this?&rdquo; he asked, as he paused, blinking, on the
threshold of his cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my kinsman, Master Matcham,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give ye good day, good ferryman,&rdquo; said Matcham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
who had dismounted, and now came forward, leading the
horse. &ldquo;Launch me your boat, I prithee; we are sore in
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gaunt ferryman continued staring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass!&rdquo; he cried at length, and laughed with
open throat.</p>

<p>Matcham coloured to his neck and winced; and Dick,
with an angry countenance, put his hand on the lout&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, churl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Fall to thy business,
and leave mocking thy betters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat, and
shoved it a little forth into the deep water. Then Dick led
in the horse, and Matcham followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye be mortal small made, master,&rdquo; said Hugh, with a
wide grin; &ldquo;something o&rsquo; the wrong model, belike.&mdash;Nay,
Master Shelton, I am for you,&rdquo; he added, getting to his oars.
&ldquo;A cat may look at a king. I did but take a shot of the
eye at Master Matcham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirrah, no more words,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Bend me your
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were by that time at the mouth of the creek, and
the view opened up and down the river. Everywhere it
was enclosed with islands. Clay banks were falling in,
willows nodding, reeds waving, martens dipping and piping.
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My master,&rdquo; said the ferryman, keeping the boat
steady with one oar, &ldquo;I have a shrewd guess that John-a-Fenne
is on the island. He bears me a black grudge to all
Sir Daniel&rsquo;s. How if I turned me up stream and landed
you an arrow-flight, above the path? Ye were best not
meddle with John Fenne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, then? is he of this company?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, mum is the word,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;But I would
go up water, Dick. How if Master Matcham came by an
arrow?&rdquo; and he laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so, Hugh,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
&ldquo;Look ye, then,&rdquo; pursued Hugh. &ldquo;Sith it shall so be,
unsling me your crossbow&mdash;so: now make it ready&mdash;good;
place me a quarrel. Ay, keep it so, and look upon me
grimly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What meaneth this?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my master, if I steal you across, it must be
under force or fear,&rdquo; replied the ferryman; &ldquo;for else, if
John Fenne got wind of it, he were like to prove my most
distressful neighbour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do these churls ride so roughly?&rdquo; Dick inquired.
&ldquo;Do they command Sir Daniel&rsquo;s own ferry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; whispered the ferryman, winking. &ldquo;Mark me!
Sir Daniel shall down. His time is out. He shall down.
Mum!&rdquo; And he bent over his oars.</p>

<p>They pulled a long way up the river, turned the tail of
an island, and came softly down a narrow channel next the
opposite bank. Then Hugh held water in midstream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must land you here among the willows,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires,&rdquo;
answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; replied Hugh, &ldquo;I dare not take ye
nearer down, for your own sake now. He watcheth me the
ferry, lying on his bow. All that go by and owe Sir Daniel
goodwill he shooteth down like rabbits. I heard him swear
it by the rood. An I had not known you of old days&mdash;ay,
and from so high upward&mdash;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; let you go on; but
for old days&rsquo; remembrance, and because ye had this toy
with you that&rsquo;s not fit for wounds or warfare, I did risk my
two poor ears to have you over whole. Content you; I
can no more, on my salvation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh was still speaking, lying on his oars, when there
came a great shout from among the willows on the island,
and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly
through the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A murrain!&rdquo; cried Hugh. &ldquo;He was on the upper
island all the while!&rdquo; He pulled straight for shore.
&ldquo;Threat me with your bow, good Dick; threat me with it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
plain,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I have tried to save your skins, save
you mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a
crash. Matcham, pale, but steady and alert, at a sign from
Dick ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore; Dick, taking
the horse by the bridle, sought to follow, but what with the
animal&rsquo;s bulk, and what with the closeness of the thicket,
both stuck fast. The horse neighed and trampled; and the
boat, which was swinging in an eddy, came on and off and
pitched with violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be, Hugh; here is no landing,&rdquo; cried Dick;
but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket
and the startled animal.</p>

<p>A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island, a longbow
in his hand. Dick saw him for an instant, with the
corner of his eye, bending the bow with a great effort, his
face crimson with hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Hugh, who goes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Master Shelton, John,&rdquo; replied the ferryman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand, Dick Shelton!&rdquo; bawled the man upon the
island. &ldquo;Ye shall have no hurt, upon the rood! Stand!&mdash;Back
out, Hugh Ferryman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick cried a taunting answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, ye shall go afoot,&rdquo; returned the man; and
he let drive an arrow.</p>

<p>The horse, struck by the shaft, lashed out in agony and
terror; the boat capsized, and next moment all were
struggling in the eddies of the river.</p>

<p>When Dick came up he was within a yard of the bank;
and before his eyes were clear, his hand had closed on something
firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward.
It was the riding-rod, that Matcham, crawling
forth upon an overhanging willow, had opportunely thrust
into his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass!&rdquo; cried Dick, as he was helped ashore,
&ldquo;that makes a life I owe you. I swim like a cannon-ball.&rdquo;
And he turned instantly towards the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
Midway over, Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his
upturned boat, while John-a-Fenne, furious at the ill-fortune
of his shot, bawled to him to hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Jack,&rdquo; said Shelton, &ldquo;run for it! Ere Hugh
can hale his barge across, or the pair of &rsquo;em can get it righted,
we may be out of cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And adding example to his words, he began to run,
dodging among the willows, and in marshy places leaping
from tussock to tussock. He had no time to look for his
direction; all he could do was to turn his back upon the
river, and put all his heart to running.</p>

<p>Presently, however, the ground began to rise, which
showed him he was still in the right way, and soon after
they came forth upon a slope of solid turf, where elms began
to mingle with the willows.</p>

<p>But here Matcham, who had been dragging far into the
rear, threw himself fairly down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me, Dick!&rdquo; he cried pantingly; &ldquo;I can no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick turned, and came back to where his companion
lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Jack, leave thee!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That were a
knave&rsquo;s trick, to be sure, when ye risked a shot and a ducking,
ay, and a drowning too, to save my life. Drowning,
in sooth; for why I did not pull you in along with me, the
saints alone can tell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; saved us both, good
Dick, for I can swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can ye so?&rdquo; cried Dick, with open eyes. It was the
one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable.
In the order of the things that he admired, next to
having killed a man in single fight, came swimming.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a lesson to despise no man. I
promised to care for you as far as Holywood, and, by the
rood, Jack, y&rsquo; are more capable to care for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick, we&rsquo;re friends now,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I never was unfriends,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
are a brave lad in your way, albeit something of a milksop
too. I never met your like before this day. But, prithee,
fetch back your breath, and let us on. Here is no place for
chatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My foot hurts shrewdly,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I had forgot your foot,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Well,
we must go the gentlier. I would I knew rightly where we
were. I have clean lost the path; yet that may be for the
better, too. An they watch the ferry, they watch the path,
belike, as well. I would Sir Daniel were back with two
score men; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind
sweeps leaves. Come, Jack, lean ye on my shoulder, ye
poor shrew. Nay, y&rsquo; are not tall enough. What age are ye,
for a wager?&mdash;twelve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am sixteen,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are poorly grown to height, then,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;But take my hand. We shall go softly, never fear. I
owe you a life; I am a good repayer, Jack, of good or evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They began to go forward up the slope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must hit the road, early or late,&rdquo; continued Dick;
&ldquo;and then for a fresh start. By the mass! but y&rsquo; have a
rickety hand, Jack. If I had a hand like that I would think
shame. I tell you,&rdquo; he went on, with a sudden chuckle,
&ldquo;I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for
a maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, never!&rdquo; cried the other, colouring high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;A did, though, for a wager!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.
&ldquo;Small blame to him. Ye look liker maid than man: and
I tell you more&mdash;y&rsquo; are a strange-looking rogue for a boy;
but for a hussy, Jack, ye would be right fair&mdash;ye would.
Ye would be well-favoured for a wench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;ye know right well that I am
none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I know that; I do but jest,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
be a man before your mother, Jack. What cheer, my
bully? Ye shall strike shrewd strokes. Now, which, I
marvel, of you or me, shall be first knighted, Jack? for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
knighted I shall be, or die for &rsquo;t. &lsquo;Sir Richard Shelton,
Knight&rsquo;: it soundeth bravely. But &lsquo;Sir John Matcham&rsquo;
soundeth not amiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prithee, Dick, stop till I drink,&rdquo; said the other, pausing
where a little clear spring welled out of the slope into a
gravelled basin no bigger than a pocket. &ldquo;And O, Dick, if
I might come by anything to eat!&mdash;my very heart aches
with hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, fool, did ye not eat at Kettley?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had made a vow&mdash;it was a sin I had been led into,&rdquo;
stammered Matcham; &ldquo;but now, if it were but dry bread,
I would eat it greedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit ye, then, and eat,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;while that I scout
a little forward for the road.&rdquo; And he took a wallet from
his girdle, wherein were bread and pieces of dry bacon, and,
while Matcham fell heartily to, struck farther forth among
the trees.</p>

<p>A little beyond there was a dip in the ground, where a
streamlet soaked among dead leaves; and beyond that,
again, the trees were better grown and stood wider, and oak
and beech began to take the place of willow and elm. The
continued tossing and pouring of the wind among the leaves
sufficiently concealed the sounds of his footsteps on the
mast; it was for the ear what a moonless night is to the eye;
but for all that Dick went cautiously, slipping from one
big trunk to another, and looking sharply about him as he
went. Suddenly a doe passed like a shadow through the
underwood in front of him, and he paused, disgusted at the
chance. This part of the wood had been certainly deserted,
but now that the poor deer had run, she was like a messenger
he should have sent before him to announce his coming;
and instead of pushing farther, he turned him to the nearest
well-grown tree, and rapidly began to climb.</p>

<p>Luck had served him well. The oak on which he had
mounted was one of the tallest in that quarter of the wood,
and easily out-topped its neighbours by a fathom and a half;
and when Dick had clambered into the topmost fork and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
clung there, swinging dizzily in the great wind, he saw behind
him the whole fenny plain as far as Kettley, and the
Till wandering among woody islets, and in front of him the
white line of high-road winding through the forest. The
boat had been righted&mdash;it was even now midway on the
ferry. Beyond that there was no sign of man, nor aught
moving but the wind. He was about to descend, when,
taking a last view, his eye lit upon a string of moving points
about the middle of the fen. Plainly a small troop was
threading the causeway, and that at a good pace; and this
gave him some concern as he shinned vigorously down the
trunk and returned across the wood for his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>A GREENWOOD COMPANY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Matcham</span> was well rested and revived; and the two lads,
winged by what Dick had seen, hurried through the remainder
of the outwood, crossed the road in safety, and
began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall Forest.
The trees grew more and more in groves, with heathy
places in between, sandy, gorsy, and dotted with old yews.
The ground became more and more uneven, full of pits and
hillocks. And with every step of the ascent the wind still
blew the shriller, and the trees bent before the gusts like
fishing-rods.</p>

<p>They had just entered one of the clearings, when Dick
suddenly clapped down upon his face among the brambles,
and began to crawl slowly backward towards the shelter of
the grove. Matcham, in great bewilderment, for he could
see no reason for this flight, still imitated his companion&rsquo;s
course; and it was not until they had gained the harbour
of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain.</p>

<p>For all reply, Dick pointed with his finger.</p>

<p>At the far end of the clearing, a fir grew high above the
neighbouring wood, and planted its black shock of foliage
clear against the sky. For about fifty feet above the ground
the trunk grew straight and solid like a column. At that
level, it split into two massive boughs; and in the fork, like
a mast-headed seaman, there stood a man in a green tabard,
spying far and wide. The sun glistened upon his hair;
with one hand he shaded his eyes to look abroad, and he kept
slowly rolling his head from side to side, with the regularity
of a machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
The lads exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us try to the left,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;We had near
fallen foully, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a piece of forest that I know not,&rdquo; Dick remarked.
&ldquo;Where goeth me this track?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us even try,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>A few yards farther, the path came to the top of a ridge
and began to go down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow.
At the foot, out of a thick wood of flowering hawthorn, two
or three roofless gables, blackened as if by fire, and a single
tall chimney, marked the ruins of a house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What may this be?&rdquo; whispered Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, by the mass, I know not,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;I
am all at sea. Let us go warily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With beating hearts, they descended through the hawthorns.
Here and there they passed signs of recent cultivation;
fruit-trees and pot-herbs ran wild among the thicket;
a sun-dial had fallen in the grass; it seemed they were treading
what once had been a garden. Yet a little farther and
they came forth before the ruins of the house.</p>

<p>It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong. A dry
ditch was dug deep about it; but it was now choked with
masonry, and bridged by a fallen rafter. The two farther
walls still stood, the sun shining through their empty
windows; but the remainder of the building had collapsed,
and now lay in a great cairn of ruin, grimed with fire.
Already in the interior a few plants were springing green
among the chinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I bethink me,&rdquo; whispered Dick, &ldquo;this must be
Grimstone. It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury; Sir
Daniel was his bane! &rsquo;Twas Bennet Hatch that burned it,
now five years agone. In sooth, &rsquo;twas pity, for it was a fair
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down in the hollow, where no wind blew, it was both
warm and still; and Matcham, laying one hand upon Dick&rsquo;s
arm, held up a warning finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then came a strange sound, breaking on the quiet. It
was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature. It was
the sound of a big man clearing his throat; and just then a
hoarse, untuneful voice broke into singing:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Then up and spake the master, the king of the outlaws:</p>
<p class="i05">&lsquo;What make ye here, my merry men, among the greenwood shaws?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="i05">And Gamelyn made answer&mdash;he looked never adown:</p>
<p class="i05">&lsquo;O, they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The singer paused, a faint clink of iron followed, and
then silence.</p>

<p>The two lads stood looking at each other. Whoever he
might be, their invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin.
And suddenly the colour came into Matcham&rsquo;s face, and next
moment he had crossed the fallen rafter, and was climbing
cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that filled the interior
of the roofless house. Dick would have withheld him, had
he been in time; as it was, he was fain to follow.</p>

<p>Right in the corner of the ruin, two rafters had fallen
crosswise, and protected a clear space no larger than a pew
in church. Into this the lads silently lowered themselves.
There they were perfectly concealed, and through an arrow
loophole commanded a view upon the farther side.</p>

<p>Peering through this they were struck stiff with terror
at their predicament. To retreat was impossible; they
scarce dared to breathe. Upon the very margin of the ditch,
not thirty feet from where they crouched, an iron caldron
bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire; and close by,
in an attitude of listening, as though he had caught some
sound of their clambering among the ruins, a tall, red-faced,
battered-looking man stood poised, an iron spoon in his
right hand, a horn and a formidable dagger at his belt.
Plainly this was the singer; plainly he had been stirring the
caldron, when some incautious step among the lumber had
fallen upon his ear. A little farther off another man lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
slumbering, rolled in a brown cloak, with a butterfly hovering
above his face. All this was in a clearing white with
daisies; and at the extreme verge a bow, a sheaf of arrows,
and part of a deer&rsquo;s carcass, hung upon a flowering hawthorn.</p>

<p>Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention,
raised the spoon to his mouth, tasted its contents,
nodded, and then fell again to stirring and singing.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p class="noind">he croaked, taking up his song where he had left it.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, sir, we walk not here at all an evil thing to do,</p>
<p class="i05">But if we meet with the good king&rsquo;s deer to shoot a shaft into.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Still as he sang, he took from time to time another
spoonful of the broth, blew upon it, and tasted it, with all
the airs of an experienced cook. At length, apparently,
he judged the mess was ready, for taking the horn from his
girdle, he blew three modulated calls.</p>

<p>The other fellow awoke, rolled over, brushed away the
butterfly, and looked about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, brother?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sot,&rdquo; replied the cook, &ldquo;dinner it is, and a dry
dinner too, with neither ale nor bread. But there is little
pleasure in the greenwood now; time was when a good
fellow could live here like a mitred abbot, set aside the rain
and the white frosts; he had his heart&rsquo;s desire both of ale
and wine. But now are men&rsquo;s spirits dead; and this John
Amend-All, save us and guard us! but a stuffed booby to
scare crows withal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are too set on meat
and drinking, Lawless. Bide ye a bit; the good time
cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look ye,&rdquo; returned the cook, &ldquo;I have even waited for
this good time sith that I was so high. I have been a grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
friar; I have been a king&rsquo;s archer; I have been a shipman,
and sailed the salt seas; and I have been in greenwood before
this, forsooth! and shot the king&rsquo;s deer. What cometh
of it? Naught! I were better to have bided in the cloister.
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All.&mdash;By&rsquo;r
Lady! here they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One after another, tall likely fellows began to stroll into
the lawn. Each as he came produced a knife and a horn
cup, helped himself from the caldron, and sat down upon
the grass to eat. They were very variously equipped and
armed; some in rusty smocks, and with nothing but a knife
and an old bow; others in the height of forest gallantry,
all in Lincoln green, both hood and jerkin, with dainty peacock
arrows in their belts, a horn upon a baldrick, and a
sword and dagger at their sides. They came in the silence
of hunger, and scarce growled a salutation, but fell instantly
to meat.</p>

<p>There were, perhaps, a score of them already gathered,
when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among
the hawthorns, and immediately after five or six woodmen
carrying a stretcher debouched upon the lawn. A tall,
lusty fellow, somewhat grizzled, and as brown as a smoked
ham, walked before them with an air of some authority,
his bow at his back, a bright boar-spear in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lads!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;good fellows all, and my right
merry friends, y&rsquo; have sung this while on a dry whistle,
and lived at little ease. But what said I ever? Abide
Fortune constantly; she turneth, turneth swift. And lo!
here is her little firstling&mdash;even that good creature, ale!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down
the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now haste ye, boys,&rdquo; the man continued. &ldquo;There
is work toward. A handful of archers are but now come
to the ferry; murrey and blue is their wear; they are our
butts&mdash;they shall all taste arrows&mdash;no man of them shall
struggle through this wood. For, lads, we are here some
fifty strong, each man of us most foully wronged; for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
they have lost lands, and some friends; and some they have
been outlawed&mdash;all oppressed! Who, then, hath done this
evil? Sir Daniel, by the rood! Shall he then profit? shall
he sit snug in our houses? shall he till our fields? shall he
suck the bone he robbed us of? I trow not. He getteth
him strength at law; he gaineth cases; nay, there is one
case he shall not gain&mdash;I have a writ here at my belt that,
please the saints, shall conquer him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second
horn of ale. He raised it, as if to pledge the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Ellis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are for vengeance&mdash;well
it becometh you!&mdash;but your poor brother o&rsquo; the greenwood
that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon,
looketh rather, for his poor part, to the profit of the thing.
He had liefer a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than
all the vengeances in purgatory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;to reach the Moat House,
Sir Daniel must pass the forest. We shall make that passage
dearer, pardy, than any battle. Then, when he has got
to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us&mdash;all his
great friends fallen and fled away, and none to give him aid&mdash;we
shall beleaguer that old fox about, and great shall be
the fall of him. &rsquo;Tis a fat buck; he will make a dinner for
us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned Lawless, &ldquo;I have eaten many of these
dinners beforehand; but the cooking of them is hot work,
good Master Ellis. And meanwhile what do we? We
make black arrows, we write rhymes, and we drink fair cold
water, that discomfortable drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are untrue, Will Lawless. Ye still smell of the
Grey Friars&rsquo; buttery; greed is your undoing,&rdquo; answered
Ellis. &ldquo;We took twenty pounds from Appleyard. We
took seven marks from the messenger last night. A day
ago we had fifty from the merchant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to-day,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;I stopped a fat
pardoner riding apace for Holywood. Here is his purse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellis counted the contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
&ldquo;Five score shillings!&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Fool, he had
more in his sandal, or stitched into his tippet. Y&rsquo; are but
a child, Tom Cuckow; ye have lost the fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, for all that, Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance.
He stood leaning on his boar-spear, and looked
round upon the rest. They, in various attitudes, took
greedily of the venison pottage, and liberally washed it
down with ale. This was a good day; they were in luck;
but business pressed, and they were speedy in their eating.
The first-comers had by this time even despatched their
dinner. Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly
asleep, like boa-constrictors; others talked together, or
overhauled their weapons; and one, whose humour was
particularly gay, holding forth an ale-horn, began to sing:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

  <p class="i2">In summer, when all is sweet.</p>

<p class="i05 s">Come winter again, with wind and rain&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i2">Come winter, with snow and sleet,</p>
<p class="i05">Get home to your places, with hoods on your faces,</p>
  <p class="i2">And sit by the fire and eat.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>All this while the two lads had listened and lain close;
only Richard had unslung his crossbow, and held ready in
one hand the windac, or grappling-iron that he used to bend
it. Otherwise they had not dared to stir; and this scene
of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon
a theatre. But now there came a strange interruption.
The tall chimney which overtopped the remainder of the
ruins rose right above their hiding-place. There came a
whistle in the air, and then a sounding smack, and the fragments
of a broken arrow fell about their ears. Some one
from the upper quarters of the wood, perhaps the very
sentinel they saw posted in the fir, had shot an arrow at the
chimney-top.</p>

<p>Matcham could not restrain a little cry, which he instantly
stifled, and even Dick started with surprise, and
dropped the windac from his fingers. But to the fellows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
on the lawn this shaft was an expected signal. They were
all afoot together, tightening their belts, testing their bow-strings,
loosening sword and dagger in the sheath. Ellis
held up his hand; his face had suddenly assumed a look
of savage energy; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye know your places. Let not one
man&rsquo;s soul escape you. Appleyard was a whet before a
meal; but now we go to table. I have three men whom I
will bitterly avenge&mdash;Harry Shelton, Simon Malmesbury,
and&rdquo;&mdash;striking his broad bosom&mdash;&ldquo;and Ellis Duckworth,
by the mass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another man came, red with hurry, through the thorns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not Sir Daniel!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;They are but
seven. Is the arrow gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It struck but now,&rdquo; replied Ellis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A murrain!&rdquo; cried the messenger. &ldquo;Methought I
heard it whistle. And I go dinnerless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the space of a minute, some running, some walking
sharply, according as their stations were nearer or farther
away, the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from
the neighbourhood of the ruined house; and the caldron,
and the fire, which was now burning low, and the dead deer&rsquo;s
carcass on the hawthorn, remained alone to testify they had
been there.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>&ldquo;BLOODY AS THE HUNTER&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the
wind. Then they arose, and with many an ache, for they
were weary with constraint, clambered through the ruins
and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter. Matcham had
picked up the windac and went first, Dick following stiffly,
with his crossbow on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;forth to Holywood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Holywood!&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;when good fellows
stand shot? Not I! I would see you hanged first, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye would leave me, would ye?&rdquo; Matcham asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, by my sooth!&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;An I be not in
time to warn these lads, I will go die with them. What!
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived
among? I trow not! Give me my windac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was nothing further from Matcham&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye sware before the saints that ye
would see me safe to Holywood. Would ye be forsworn?
Would you desert me&mdash;a perjurer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I swear for the best,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;I meant
it too; but now! But look ye, Jack, turn again with me.
Let me but warn these men, and, if needs must, stand shot
with them; then shall all be clear, and I will on again to
Holywood and purge mine oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye but deride me,&rdquo; answered Matcham. &ldquo;These men
ye go to succour are the same that hunt me to my ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick scratched his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is no remedy.
What would ye? Ye run no great peril, man; and these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
are in the way of death. Death!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Think of
it! What a murrain do ye keep me here for? Give me the
windac. St. George! shall they all die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard Shelton,&rdquo; said Matcham, looking him squarely
in the face, &ldquo;would ye, then, join party with Sir Daniel?
Have ye not ears? Heard ye not this Ellis, what he said?
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the
father that men slew? &lsquo;Harry Shelton,&rsquo; he said; and Sir
Harry Shelton was your father, as the sun shines in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would ye?&rdquo; Dick cried again. &ldquo;Would ye
have me credit thieves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I have heard it before now,&rdquo; returned Matcham.
&ldquo;The fame goeth currently, it was Sir Daniel slew him. He
slew him under oath; in his own house he shed the innocent
blood. Heaven wearies for the avenging on&rsquo;t; and you&mdash;the
man&rsquo;s son&mdash;ye go about to comfort and defend the
murderer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; cried the lad, &ldquo;I know not. It may be; what
know I? But see here: This man hath bred me up and
fostered me, and his men I have hunted with and played
among; and to leave them in the hour of peril&mdash;O, man, if
I did that, I were stark dead to honour! Nay, Jack, ye
would not ask it; ye would not wish me to be base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your father, Dick!&rdquo; said Matcham, somewhat
wavering. &ldquo;Your father? and your oath to me? Ye took
the saints to witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; cried Shelton. &ldquo;Nay, he would have
me go! If Sir Daniel slew him, when the hour comes this
hand shall slay Sir Daniel; but neither him nor his will I
desert in peril. And for mine oath, good Jack, ye shall
absolve me of it here. For the lives&rsquo; sake of many men that
hurt you not, and for mine honour, ye shall set me free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Dick? Never!&rdquo; returned Matcham. &ldquo;An ye
leave me, y&rsquo; are forsworn, and so I shall declare it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My blood heats,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Give me the windac!
Give it me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save you in your teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
&ldquo;Not?&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>They stood, looking in each other&rsquo;s eyes, each ready for
a spring. Then Dick leaped; and though Matcham turned
instantly and fled, in two bounds he was overtaken, the
windac was twisted from his grasp, he was thrown roughly
to the ground, and Dick stood across him, flushed and
menacing, with doubled fist. Matcham lay where he
had fallen, with his face in the grass, not thinking of
resistance.</p>

<p>Dick bent his bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;Oath or no oath,
ye may go hang for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned and began to run. Matcham was on his
feet at once, and began running after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo; cried Dick, stopping. &ldquo;What
make ye after me? Stand off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will follow an I please,&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;This wood
is free to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back, by&rsquo;r Lady!&rdquo; returned Dick, raising his
bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, y&rsquo; are a brave boy!&rdquo; retorted Matcham. &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; have done me ill enough.
Go, then. Go your way in fair wise; or, whether I will or
not, I must even drive you to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Matcham doggedly, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are the stronger.
Do your worst. I shall not leave to follow thee, Dick,
unless thou makest me,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Dick was almost beside himself. It went against his
heart to beat a creature so defenceless; and, for the life of
him, he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome
and, as he began to think, perhaps untrue companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are mad, I think,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Fool-fellow, I am
hasting to your foes; as fast as foot can carry me, go I
thither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care not, Dick,&rdquo; replied the lad. &ldquo;If y&rsquo; are bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
to die, Dick, I&rsquo;ll die too. I would liefer go with you to
prison than to go free without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;I may stand no longer
prating. Follow me, if ye must; but if ye play me false,
it shall but little advance you, mark ye that. Shalt have a
quarrel in thine inwards, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Dick took once more to his heels, keeping in
the margin of the thicket, and looking briskly about him as
he went. At a good pace he rattled out of the dell, and
came again into the more open quarters of the wood. To
the left a little eminence appeared, spotted with golden
gorse, and crowned with a black tuft of firs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see from there,&rdquo; he thought, and struck for it
across a heathy clearing.</p>

<p>He had gone but a few yards, when Matcham touched
him on the arm, and pointed. To the eastward of the
summit there was a dip, and, as it were, a valley passing to
the other side; the heath was not yet out; all the ground
was rusty, like an unsecured buckler, and dotted sparingly
with yews; and there, one following another, Dick saw half
a score green jerkins mounting the ascent, and marching at
their head, conspicuous by his boar-spear, Ellis Duckworth
in person. One after another gained the top, showed for
a moment against the sky, and then dipped upon the farther
side, until the last was gone.</p>

<p>Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So y&rsquo; are to be true to me, Jack?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
thought ye were of the other party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matcham began to sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Now the saints behold
us! would ye snivel&rsquo; for a word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye hurt me,&rdquo; sobbed Matcham. &ldquo;Ye hurt me when ye
threw me down. Y&rsquo; are a coward to abuse your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, that is fool&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; said Dick roughly. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; had
no title to my windac, Master John. I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; done right
to have well basted you. If ye go with me, ye must obey
me; and so, come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
Matcham had half a thought to stay behind; but, seeing
that Dick continued to scour full-tilt towards the eminence,
and not so much as looked across his shoulder, he soon
thought better of that, and began to run in turn. But the
ground was very difficult and steep; Dick had already a
long start, and had, at any rate, the lighter heels, and he
had long since come to the summit, crawled forward through
the firs, and ensconced himself in a thick tuft of gorse, before
Matcham, panting like a deer, rejoined him, and lay
down in silence by his side.</p>

<p>Below, in the bottom of a considerable valley, the short
cut from Tunstall hamlet wound downwards to the ferry.
It was well beaten, and the eye followed it easily from point
to point. Here it was bordered by open glades; there the
forest closed upon it; every hundred yards it ran beside an
ambush. Far down the path, the sun shone on seven steel
salets, and from time to time, as the trees opened, Selden
and his men could be seen riding briskly, still bent upon Sir
Daniel&rsquo;s mission. The wind had somewhat fallen, but still
tussled merrily with the trees, and, perhaps, had Appleyard
been there, he would have drawn a warning from the
troubled conduct of the birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, mark,&rdquo; Dick whispered. &ldquo;They be already
well advanced into the wood; their safety lieth rather in
continuing forward. But see ye where this wide glade
runneth down before us, and in the midst of it, these two
score trees make like an island? There were their safety.
An they but come sound as far as that, I will make shift to
warn them. But my heart misgiveth me; they are but
seven against so many, and they but carry crossbows. The
long-bow, Jack, will have the uppermost ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Selden and his men still wound up the path,
ignorant of their danger, and momently drew nearer hand.
Once, indeed, they paused, drew into a group, and seemed
to point and listen. But it was something from far away
across the plain that had arrested their attention&mdash;a hollow
growl of cannon that came, from time to time, upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
wind, and told of the great battle. It was worth a thought,
to be sure; for if the voice of the big guns were thus become
audible in Tunstall Forest, the fight must have rolled ever
eastward, and the day, by consequence, gone sore against
Sir Daniel and the lords of the dark rose.</p>

<p>But presently the little troop began again to move forward,
and came next to a very open, heathy portion of the
way, where but a single tongue of forest ran down to join
the road. They were but just abreast of this, when an
arrow shone flying. One of the men threw up his arms, his
horse reared, and both fell and struggled together in a mass.
Even from where the boys lay they could hear the rumour
of the men&rsquo;s voices crying out; they could see the startled
horses prancing, and, presently, as the troop began to recover
from their first surprise, one fellow beginning to dismount.
A second arrow from somewhat farther off glanced in a wide
arch; a second rider bit the dust. The man who was dismounting
lost hold upon the rein, and his horse fled galloping,
and dragged him by the foot along the road, bumping
from stone to stone, and battered by the fleeing hoofs. The
four who still kept the saddle instantly broke and scattered;
one wheeled and rode, shrieking, towards the ferry; the
other three, with loose rein and flying raiment, came galloping
up the road from Tunstall. From every clump they
passed an arrow sped. Soon a horse fell, but the rider
found his feet and continued to pursue his comrades till a
second shot despatched him. Another man fell; then
another horse; out of the whole troop there was but one
fellow left, and he on foot; only, in different directions, the
noise of the galloping of three riderless horses was dying fast
into the distance.</p>

<p>All this time not one of the assailants had for a moment
showed himself. Here and there along the path, horse or
man rolled, undespatched, in his agony; but no merciful
enemy broke cover to put them from their pain.</p>

<p>The solitary survivor stood bewildered in the road beside
his fallen charger. He had come the length of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
broad glade, with the island of timber, pointed out by Dick.
He was not, perhaps, five hundred yards from where the
boys lay hidden; and they could see him plainly, looking to
and fro in deadly expectation. But nothing came; and the
man began to pluck up his courage, and suddenly unslung
and bent his bow. At the same time, by something in his
action, Dick recognised Selden.</p>

<p>At this offer of resistance, from all about him in the
covert of the woods there went up the sound of laughter.
A score of men, at least&mdash;for this was the very thickest of
the ambush&mdash;joined in this cruel and untimely mirth. Then
an arrow glanced over Selden&rsquo;s shoulder; and he leaped
and ran a little back. Another dart struck quivering at
his heel. He made for the cover. A third shaft leaped
out right in his face, and fell short in front of him. And
then the laughter was repeated loudly, rising and re-echoing
from different thickets.</p>

<p>It was plain that his assailants were but baiting him,
as men, in those days, baited the poor bull, or as the cat
still trifles with the mouse. The skirmish was well over;
farther down the road, a fellow in green was already calmly
gathering the arrows; and now, in the evil pleasure of their
hearts, they gave themselves the spectacle of their poor
fellow-sinner in his torture.</p>

<p>Selden began to understand; he uttered a roar of anger,
shouldered his crossbow, and sent a quarrel at a venture
into the wood. Chance favoured him, for a slight cry
responded. Then, throwing down his weapon, Selden began
to run before him up the glade, and almost in a straight
line for Dick and Matcham.</p>

<p>The companions of the Black Arrow now began to shoot
in earnest. But they were properly served; their chance
had passed; most of them had now to shoot against the
sun; and Selden, as he ran, bounded from side to side to
baffle and deceive their aim. Best of all, by turning up the
glade he had defeated their preparations; there were no
marksmen posted higher up than the one whom he had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
killed or wounded; and the confusion of the foresters&rsquo;
counsels soon became apparent. A whistle sounded thrice,
and then again twice. It was repeated from another
quarter. The woods on either side became full of the sound
of people bursting through the underwood; and a bewildered
deer ran out into the open, stood for a second on
three feet, with nose in air, and then plunged again into the
thicket.</p>

<p>Selden still ran, bounding; ever and again an arrow
followed him, but still would miss. It began to appear as
if he might escape. Dick had his bow armed, ready to
support him; even Matcham, forgetful of his interest, took
sides at heart for the poor fugitive; and both lads glowed
and trembled in the ardour of their hearts.</p>

<p>He was within fifty yards of them when an arrow struck
him, and he fell. He was up again, indeed, upon the instant;
but now he ran staggering, and, like a blind man,
turned aside from his direction.</p>

<p>Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This way! here is help! Nay,
run, fellow&mdash;run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the
shoulder, between the plates of his brigandine, and, piercing
through his jack, brought him, like a stone, to earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O the poor heart!&rdquo; cried Matcham, with clasped
hands.</p>

<p>And Dick stood petrified upon the hill, a mark for
archery.</p>

<p>Ten to one he had speedily been shot&mdash;for the foresters
were furious with themselves, and taken unawares by Dick&rsquo;s
appearance in the rear of their position&mdash;but instantly out
of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads,
a stentorian voice arose, the voice of Ellis Duckworth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; it roared. &ldquo;Shoot not! Take him alive!
It is young Shelton&mdash;Harry&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several
times, and was again taken up and repeated farther off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
The whistle, it appeared, was John Amend-All&rsquo;s battle
trumpet, by which he published his directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, foul fortune!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We are undone.
Swiftly, Jack, come swiftly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine
clump that covered the summit of the hill.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>TO THE DAY&rsquo;S END</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was, indeed, high time for them to run. On every side
the company of the Black Arrow was making for the hill.
Some, being better runners, or having open ground to run
upon, had far outstripped the others, and were already close
upon the goal; some, following valleys, had spread out to
right and left, and outflanked the lads on either side.</p>

<p>Dick plunged into the nearest cover. It was a tall grove
of oaks, firm under foot and clear of underbrush, and as it
lay down hill, they made good speed. There followed next
a piece of open, which Dick avoided, holding to his left.
Two minutes after, and the same obstacle arising, the lads
followed the same course. Thus it followed that, while the
lads, bending continually to the left, drew nearer and nearer
to the high-road and the river which they had crossed an
hour or two before, the great bulk of their pursuers were
leaning to the other hand, and running towards Tunstall.</p>

<p>The lads paused to breathe. There was no sound of
pursuit. Dick put his ear to the ground, and still there
was nothing; but the wind, to be sure, still made a turmoil
in the trees, and it was hard to make certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On again!&rdquo; said Dick; and, tired as they were, and
Matcham limping with his injured foot, they pulled themselves
together, and once more pelted down the hill.</p>

<p>Three minutes later they were breasting through a low
thicket of evergreen. High overhead the tall trees made a
continuous roof of foliage. It was a pillared grove, as high
as a cathedral, and except for the hollies among which the
lads were struggling, open and smoothly swarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
On the other side, pushing through the last fringe of
evergreen, they blundered forth again into the open twilight
of the grove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; cried a voice.</p>

<p>And there, between the huge stems, not fifty feet before
them, they beheld a stout fellow in green, sore blown with
running, who instantly drew an arrow to the head and
covered them. Matcham stopped with a cry; but Dick,
without a pause, ran straight upon the forester, drawing his
dagger as he went. The other, whether he was startled by
the daring of the onslaught, or whether he was hampered
by his orders, did not shoot: he stood wavering; and before
he had time to come to himself, Dick bounded at his throat,
and sent him sprawling backward on the turf. The arrow
went one way and the bow another with a sounding twang.
The disarmed forester grappled his assailant; but the
dagger shone and descended twice. Then came a couple
of groans, and then Dick rose to his feet again, and the man
lay motionless, stabbed to the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On!&rdquo; said Dick; and he once more pelted forward,
Matcham trailing in the rear. To say truth, they made but
poor speed of it by now, labouring dismally as they ran, and
catching for their breath like fish. Matcham had a cruel
stitch, and his head swam; and as for Dick, his knees were
like lead. But they kept up the form of running with undiminished
courage.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the end of the grove. It stopped
abruptly; and there, a few yards before them, was the high-road
from Risingham to Shoreby, lying, at this point, between
two even walls of forest.</p>

<p>At the sight Dick paused; and as soon as he stopped
running, he became aware of a confused noise, which rapidly
grew louder. It was at first like the rush of a very high gust
of wind, but it soon became more definite, and resolved
itself into the galloping of horses; and then, in a flash, a
whole company of men-at-arms came driving round the
corner, swept before the lads, and were gone again upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
instant. They rode as for their lives, in complete disorder;
some of them were wounded; riderless horses galloped at
their side with bloody saddles. They were plainly fugitives
from the great battle.</p>

<p>The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away
towards Shoreby, before fresh hoofs came echoing in their
wake, and another deserter clattered down the road; this
time a single rider, and, by his splendid armour, a man of
high degree. Close after him there followed several baggage-waggons,
fleeing at an ungainly canter, the drivers flailing
at the horses as if for life. These must have run early in
the day; but their cowardice was not to save them. For
just before they came abreast of where the lads stood
wondering, a man in hacked armour, and seemingly beside
himself with fury, overtook the waggons, and with the
truncheon of a sword began to cut the drivers down. Some
leaped from their places and plunged into the wood; the
others he sabred as they sat, cursing them the while for
cowards in a voice that was scarce human.</p>

<p>All this time the noise in the distance had continued to
increase; the rumble of carts, the clatter of horses, the cries
of men, a great, confused rumour, came swelling on the
wind; and it was plain that the rout of a whole army was
pouring, like an inundation, down the road.</p>

<p>Dick stood sombre. He had meant to follow the highway
till the turn for Holywood, and now he had to change
his plan. But above all, he had recognised the colours of
Earl Risingham, and he knew that the battle had gone
finally against the rose of Lancaster. Had Sir Daniel
joined, and was he now a fugitive, and ruined? or had he
deserted to the side of York, and was he forfeit to honour?
It was an ugly choice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said sternly; and, turning on his heel, he
began to walk forward through the grove, with Matcham
limping in his rear.</p>

<p>For some time they continued to thread the forest in
silence. It was now growing late; the sun was setting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
the plain beyond Kettley; the tree-tops overhead glowed
golden; but the shadows had begun to grow darker and the
chill of the night to fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was anything to eat!&rdquo; cried Dick suddenly,
pausing as he spoke.</p>

<p>Matcham sat down and began to weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye can weep for your own supper, but when it was to
save men&rsquo;s lives your heart was hard enough,&rdquo; said Dick
contemptuously. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; have seven deaths upon your conscience,
Master John; I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er forgive you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conscience!&rdquo; cried Matcham, looking fiercely up.
&ldquo;Mine! And ye have the man&rsquo;s red blood upon your
dagger! And wherefore did ye slay him, the poor soul?
He drew his arrow, but he let not fly; he held you in his
hand, and spared you! &rsquo;Tis as brave to kill a kitten as a
man that not defends himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was struck dumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I slew him fair. I ran me in upon his bow,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a coward blow,&rdquo; returned Matcham. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are
but a lout and bully, Master Dick; ye but abuse advantages;
let there come a stronger, we will see you truckle at his boot!
Ye care not for vengeance, neither&mdash;for your father&rsquo;s death
that goes unpaid, and his poor ghost that clamoureth for
justice. But if there come but a poor creature in your
hands that lacketh skill and strength, and would befriend
you, down she shall go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was too furious to observe that &ldquo;she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and here is news! Of any two
the one will still be stronger. The better man throweth the
worse, and the worse is well served. Ye deserve a belting,
Master Matcham, for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness
to me-ward; and what ye deserve ye shall have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dick, who, even in his angriest temper, still preserved
the appearance of composure, began to unbuckle
his belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here shall be your supper,&rdquo; he said grimly.</p>

<p>Matcham had stopped his tears; he was as white as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
sheet, but he looked Dick steadily in the face, and never
moved. Dick took a step, swinging the belt. Then he
paused, embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin, weary
face of his companion. His courage began to subside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say ye were in the wrong, then,&rdquo; he said lamely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;I was in the right. Come,
cruel! I be lame; I be weary; I resist not; I ne&rsquo;er did thee
hurt; come, beat me, coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick raised the belt at this last provocation; but
Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an
apprehension, that his heart failed him yet again. The
strap fell by his side, and he stood irresolute, feeling like a
fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A plague upon thee, shrew!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An ye be so
feeble of hand ye should keep the closer guard upon your
tongue. But I&rsquo;ll be hanged before I beat you!&rdquo; and he put
on his belt again. &ldquo;Beat you I will not,&rdquo; he continued;
&ldquo;but forgive you?&mdash;never. I knew ye not; ye were
my master&rsquo;s enemy; I lent you my horse; my dinner ye
have eaten; y&rsquo; have called me a man o&rsquo; wood, a coward,
and a bully. Nay, by the mass! the measure is filled and
runneth over. &rsquo;Tis a great thing to be weak, I trow: ye
can do your worst, yet shall none punish you; ye may steal
a man&rsquo;s weapons in the hour of need, yet may the man not
take his own again;&mdash;y&rsquo; are weak, forsooth! Nay, then, if
one cometh charging at you with a lance, and crieth he is
weak, ye must let him pierce your body through! Tut!
fool words!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet ye beat me not,&rdquo; returned Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let be,&rdquo; said Dick&mdash;&ldquo;let be. I will instruct you.
Y&rsquo; have been ill-nurtured, methinks, and yet ye have the
makings of some good, and, beyond all question, saved me
from the river. Nay, I had forgotten it; I am as thankless
as thyself. But, come, let us on. An we be for Holywood
this night, ay, or to-morrow early, we had best set forward
speedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
good-humour, Matcham had forgiven him nothing. His
violence, the recollection of the forester whom he had slain&mdash;above
all, the vision of the upraised belt, were things not
easily to be forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will thank you, for the form&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Matcham.
&ldquo;But, in sooth, good Master Shelton, I had liefer find my
way alone. Here is a wide wood; prithee, let each choose
his path; I owe you a dinner and a lesson. Fare ye well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;if that be your tune, so be it, and
a plague be with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each turned aside, and they began walking off severally,
with no thought of the direction, intent solely on their
quarrel. But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was
called, and Matcham came running after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it were unmannerly to part so coldly.
Here is my hand, and my heart with it. For all that wherein
you have so excellently served and helped me&mdash;not for the
form, but from the heart, I thank you. Fare ye right well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lad,&rdquo; returned Dick, taking the hand which was
offered him, &ldquo;good speed to you, if speed you may. But I
misdoubt it shrewdly. Y&rsquo; are too disputatious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then they separated for the second time; and presently
it was Dick who was running after Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take my crossbow; shalt not go
unarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A crossbow!&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;Nay, boy, I have
neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it.
It were no help to me, good boy. But yet I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night had now fallen, and under the trees they could
no longer read each other&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go some little way with you,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;The
night is dark. I would fain leave you on a path, at least.
My mind misgiveth me, y&rsquo; are likely to be lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without any more words he began to walk forward,
and the other once more followed him. The blackness grew
thicker and thicker; only here and there, in open places,
they saw the sky, dotted with small stars. In the distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued
to be faintly audible; but with every step they left it farther
in the rear.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came
forth upon a broad patch of heathy open. It glimmered in
the light of the stars, shaggy with fern and islanded with
clumps of yew. And here they paused and looked upon
each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are weary?&rdquo; Dick said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am so weary,&rdquo; answered Matcham, &ldquo;that methinks
I could lie down and die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the chiding of a river,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Let
us go so far forth, for I am sore athirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ground sloped down gently; and, sure enough, in
the bottom, they found a little murmuring river, running
among willows. Here they threw themselves down together
by the brink; and putting their mouths to the level
of a starry pool, they drank their fill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;it may not be. I can no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw a pit as we came down,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Let us
lie down therein and sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but with all my heart!&rdquo; cried Matcham.</p>

<p>The pit was sandy and dry; a shock of brambles hung
upon one edge, and made a partial shelter; and there the
two lads lay down, keeping close together for the sake of
warmth, their quarrel all forgotten. And soon sleep fell
upon them like a cloud, and under the dew and stars they
rested peacefully.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>THE HOODED FACE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">They</span> awoke in the grey of the morning; the birds were not
yet in full song, but twittered here and there among the
woods; the sun was not yet up, but the eastern sky was
barred with solemn colours. Half-starved and over-weary
as they were, they lay without moving, sunk in a delightful
lassitude. And as they thus lay, the clang of a bell fell
suddenly upon their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bell!&rdquo; said Dick, sitting up. &ldquo;Can we be, then,
so near to Holywood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little after, the bell clanged again, but this time somewhat
nearer hand; and from that time forth, and still
drawing nearer and nearer, it continued to sound brokenly
abroad in the silence of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, what should this betoken?&rdquo; said Dick, who
was now broad awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is some one walking,&rdquo; returned Matcham, &ldquo;and
the bell tolleth ever as he moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that well,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;But wherefore?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods? Jack,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;laugh at me an ye will, but I like not the hollow sound
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Matcham, with a shiver, &ldquo;it hath a doleful
note. And the day were not come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just then the bell, quickening its pace, began to ring
thick and hurried, and then it gave a signal hammering
jangle, and was silent for a space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as though the bearer had run for a paternoster-while,
and then leaped the river,&rdquo; Dick observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
&ldquo;And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward,&rdquo;
added Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Dick&mdash;&ldquo;nay, not so soberly, Jack.
&rsquo;Tis a man that walketh you right speedily. &rsquo;Tis a man in
some fear of his life, or about some hurried business. See
ye not how swift the beating draweth near?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is now close by,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>They were now on the edge of the pit; and as the pit
itself was on a certain eminence, they commanded a view
over the greater proportion of the clearing, up to the thick
woods that closed it in.</p>

<p>The daylight, which was very clear and grey, showed
them a riband of white footpath wandering among the
gorse. It passed some hundred yards from the pit, and ran
the whole length of the clearing, east and west. By the line
of its course, Dick judged it should lead more or less directly
to the Moat House.</p>

<p>Upon this path, stepping forth from the margin of the
wood, a white figure now appeared. It paused a little, and
seemed to look about; and then, at a slow pace, and bent
almost double, it began to draw near across the heath. At
every step the bell clanked. Face it had none; a white hood,
not even pierced with eye-holes, veiled the head; and as
the creature moved, it seemed to feel its way with the
tapping of a stick. Fear fell upon the lads, as cold as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A leper!&rdquo; said Dick hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His touch is death,&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;Let us run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;See ye not?&mdash;he is stone-blind.
He guideth him with a staff. Let us lie still; the
wind bloweth towards the path, and he will go by and hurt
us not. Alas, poor soul, and we should rather pity him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pity him when he is by,&rdquo; replied Matcham.</p>

<p>The blind leper was now about half-way towards them,
and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face.
He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting
sickness, and even now he walked with a vigorous step.
The dismal beating of his bell, the pattering of the stick, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
eyeless screen before his countenance, and the knowledge
that he was not only doomed to death and suffering, but
shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men, filled the
lads&rsquo; bosoms with dismay; and at every step that brought
him nearer, their courage and strength seemed to desert
them.</p>

<p>As he came about level with the pit, he paused, and
turned his face full upon the lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary be my shield! He sees us!&rdquo; said Matcham
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Dick. &ldquo;He doth but hearken.
He is blind, fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leper looked or listened, whichever he was really
doing, for some seconds. Then he began to move on again,
but presently paused once more, and again turned and
seemed to gaze upon the lads. Even Dick became dead-white
and closed his eyes, as if by the mere sight he might
become infected. But soon the bell sounded, and this time,
without any further hesitation, the leper crossed the remainder
of the little heath and disappeared into the covert
of the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He saw us,&rdquo; said Matcham. &ldquo;I could swear it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; returned Dick, recovering some sparks of
courage. &ldquo;He but heard us. He was in fear, poor soul!
An ye were blind, and walked in a perpetual night, ye would
start yourself, if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried &lsquo;Peep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick, good Dick, he saw us,&rdquo; repeated Matcham.
&ldquo;When a man hearkeneth, he doth not as this man; he
doth otherwise, Dick. This was seeing; it was not hearing.
He means foully. Hark, else, if his bell be not stopped!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the case. The bell rang no longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I like not that. Nay,&rdquo; he cried
again, &ldquo;I like that little. What may this betoken? Let
us go, by the mass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hath gone east,&rdquo; added Matcham. &ldquo;Good Dick,
let us go westward straight. I shall not breathe till I have
my back turned upon that leper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
&ldquo;Jack, y&rsquo; are too cowardly,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;We shall
go fair for Holywood, or as fair, at least, as I can guide you,
and that will be due north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were afoot at once, passed the stream upon some
stepping-stones, and began to mount on the other side,
which was steeper, towards the margin of the wood. The
ground became very uneven, full of knolls and hollows;
trees grew scattered or in clumps; it became difficult to
choose a path, and the lads somewhat wandered. They
were weary, besides, with yesterday&rsquo;s exertions and the
lack of food, and they moved but heavily and dragged their
feet among the sand.</p>

<p>Presently, coming to the top of a knoll, they were aware
of the leper, some hundred feet in front of them, crossing
the line of their march by a hollow. His bell was silent, his
staff no longer tapped the ground, and he went before him
with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees.
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket.</p>

<p>The lads, at the first glimpse, had crouched behind a
tuft of gorse; there they lay, horror-struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain, he pursueth us,&rdquo; said Dick&mdash;&ldquo;certain. He
held the clapper of his bell in one hand, saw ye? that it
should not sound. Now may the saints aid and guide us,
for I have no strength to combat pestilence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What maketh he?&rdquo; cried Matcham. &ldquo;What doth he
want? Who ever heard the like, that a leper, out of mere
malice, should pursue unfortunates? Hath he not his bell
to that very end, that people may avoid him? Dick, there
is below this something deeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I care not,&rdquo; moaned Dick; &ldquo;the strength is
gone out of me; my legs are like water. The saints be mine
assistance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would ye lie there idle?&rdquo; cried Matcham. &ldquo;Let us
back into the open. We have the better chance; he cannot
steal upon us unawares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;My time is come; and peradventure
he may pass us by.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
&ldquo;Bend me, then, your bow!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;What!
will ye be a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick crossed himself. &ldquo;Would ye have me shoot upon
a leper?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The hand would fail me. Nay,
now,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;nay, now, let be. With sound men I
will fight, but not with ghosts and lepers. Which this is,
I wot not. One or other, Heaven be our protection!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;if this be man&rsquo;s courage, what
a poor thing is man! But sith ye will do naught, let us lie
close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came a single, broken jangle on the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hath missed his hold upon the clapper,&rdquo; whispered
Matcham. &ldquo;Saints! how near he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick answered never a word; his teeth were near
chattering.</p>

<p>Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some
bushes; then the leper&rsquo;s head was thrust forth from behind
a trunk, and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood
before he once again withdrew. To their stretched
senses the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the
creak of twigs; and they heard the beating of each other&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a cry, the leper sprang into the open close
by, and ran straight upon the lads. They, shrieking aloud,
separated and began to run different ways. But their
horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham, ran him swiftly
down, and had him almost instantly a prisoner. The lad
gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest,
he had one spasm of struggling, and then all his limbs relaxed,
and he fell limp into his captor&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>Dick heard the cry and turned. He saw Matcham fall;
and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived. With
a cry of pity and anger, he unslung and bent his arblast.
But ere he had time to shoot, the leper held up his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your shot, Dickon!&rdquo; cried a familiar voice.
&ldquo;Hold your shot, mad wag! Know ye not a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, laying down Matcham on the turf, he undid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
the hood from off his face, and disclosed the features of Sir
Daniel Brackley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, by the mass, Sir Daniel!&rdquo; returned the knight.
&ldquo;Would ye shoot upon your guardian, rogue? But here
is this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And there he broke off and pointing to Matcham,
asked&mdash;&ldquo;How call ye him, Dick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I call him Master Matcham. Know
ye him not? He said ye knew him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel, &ldquo;I know the lad&rdquo;; and he
chuckled. &ldquo;But he has fainted; and, by my sooth, he
might have had less to faint for. Hey, Dick? Did I put
the fear of death upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir Daniel, ye did that,&rdquo; said Dick, and sighed
again at the mere recollection. &ldquo;Nay, sir, saving your
respect, I had as lief &rsquo;a&rsquo; met the devil in person; and to
speak truth, I am yet all a-quake. But what made ye, sir,
in such a guise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Daniel&rsquo;s brow grew suddenly black with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ye do well to mind me
of it! What? I skulked for my poor life in my own wood
of Tunstall, Dick. We were ill sped at the battle; we but
got there to be swept among the rout. Where be all my
good men-at-arms? Dick, by the mass, I know not! We
were swept down; the shot fell thick among us; I have not
seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall. For
myself, I came sound to Shoreby, and being mindful of the
Black Arrow, got me this gown and bell, and came softly
by the path for the Moat House. There is no disguise to be
compared with it; the jingle of this bell would scare me
the stoutest outlaw in the forest; they would all turn pale
to hear it. At length I came by you and Matcham. I
could see but evilly through this same hood, and was not sure
of you, being chiefly, and for many a good cause, astonished
at the finding you together. Moreover, in the open, where
I had to go slowly and tap with my staff, I feared to disclose
myself.&mdash;But see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this poor shrew begins a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
little to revive. A little good canary will comfort the heart
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight, from under his long dress, produced a stout
bottle, and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the
patient, who returned gradually to consciousness, and began
to roll dim eyes from one to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer, Jack?&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;It was no leper
after all; it was Sir Daniel! See!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swallow me a good draught of this,&rdquo; said the knight.
&ldquo;This will give you manhood. Thereafter I will give you
both a meal, and we shall all three on to Tunstall. For,
Dick,&rdquo; he continued, laying forth bread and meat upon the
grass, &ldquo;I will avow to you, in all good conscience, it irks
me sorely to be safe between four walls. Not since I backed
a horse have I been pressed so hard; peril of life, jeopardy
of land and livelihood, and, to sum up, all these losels in
the wood to hunt me down. But I be not yet shent. Some
of my lads will pick me their way home. Hatch hath ten
fellows; Selden, he had six. Nay, we shall soon be strong
again; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate
and undeserving Lord of York, why, Dick, we&rsquo;ll be a
man again, and go a-horseback!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, the knight filled himself a horn of canary,
and pledged his ward in dumb show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selden,&rdquo; Dick faltered&mdash;&ldquo;Selden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he paused
again.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; he cried, in a changed voice. &ldquo;Selden?
Speak! What of Selden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the
massacre.</p>

<p>The knight heard in silence; but, as he listened, his
countenance became convulsed with rage and grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;on my right hand, I swear to
avenge it! If that I fail, if that I spill not ten men&rsquo;s souls
for each, may this hand wither from my body! I broke
this Duckworth like a rush; I beggared him to his door;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
I burned the thatch above his head; I drove him from this
country; and now, cometh he back to beard me? Nay, but,
Duckworth, this time it shall go bitter hard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for some time, his face working.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; he cried suddenly.&mdash;&ldquo;And you here,&rdquo; he added
to Matcham, &ldquo;swear me an oath to follow straight to the
Moat House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pledge mine honour,&rdquo; replied Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What make I with your honour?&rdquo; cried the knight.
&ldquo;Swear me upon your mother&rsquo;s welfare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matcham gave the required oath; and Sir Daniel readjusted
the hood over his face, and prepared his bell and
staff. To see him once more in that appalling travesty
somewhat revived the horror of his two companions. But
the knight was soon upon his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat with despatch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and follow me yarely
to mine house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he set forth again into the woods; and
presently after the bell began to sound, numbering his steps,
and the two lads sat by their untasted meal, and heard it
die slowly away up-hill into the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so ye go to Tunstall?&rdquo; Dick inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yea, verily,&rdquo; said Matcham, &ldquo;when needs must! I
am braver behind Sir Daniel&rsquo;s back than to his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ate hastily, and set forth along the path through
the airy upper levels of the forest, where great beeches stood
apart among green lawns, and the birds and squirrels made
merry on the boughs. Two hours later they began to descend
upon the other side, and already, among the tree-tops,
saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Matcham, pausing, &ldquo;ye shall take your
leave of your friend Jack, whom y&rsquo; are to see no more.
Come, Dick, forgive him what he did amiss, as he, for his
part, cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wherefore so?&rdquo; asked Dick. &ldquo;An we both go
to Tunstall, I shall see you yet again, I trow, and that right
often.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll never again see poor Jack Matcham,&rdquo; replied
the other, &ldquo;that was so fearful and burthensome, and yet
plucked you from the river; ye&rsquo;ll not see him more, Dick,
by mine honour!&rdquo; He held his arms open, and the lads
embraced and kissed. &ldquo;And, Dick,&rdquo; continued Matcham,
&ldquo;my spirit bodeth ill. Y&rsquo; are now to see a new Sir Daniel;
for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly,
and fortune followed him; but now, methinks, when his fate
hath come upon him, and he runs the adventure of his life,
he will prove but a foul lord to both of us. He may be brave
in battle, but he hath the liar&rsquo;s eye; there is fear in his eye,
Dick, and fear is as cruel as the wolf! We go down into that
house, St. Mary guide us forth again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they continued their descent in silence, and came
out at last before Sir Daniel&rsquo;s forest stronghold, where it
stood, low and shady, flanked with round towers and stained
with moss and lichen, in the lilied waters of the moat.
Even as they appeared, the doors were opened, the bridge
lowered, and Sir Daniel himself, with Hatch and the parson
at his side, stood ready to receive them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>DICK ASKS QUESTIONS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Moat House stood not far from the rough forest road.
Externally it was a compact rectangle of red stone, flanked
at each corner by a round tower, pierced for archery and
battlemented at the top. Within, it enclosed a narrow
court. The moat was perhaps twelve feet wide, crossed
by a single drawbridge. It was supplied with water by a
trench, leading to a forest pool, and commanded, through
its whole length, from the battlements of the two southern
towers. Except that one or two tall and thick trees had
been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the walls,
the house was in a good posture for defence.</p>

<p>In the court Dick found a part of the garrison busy with
preparations for defence, and gloomily discussing the
chances of a siege. Some were making arrows, some sharpening
swords that had long been disused; but, even as they
worked, they shook their heads.</p>

<p>Twelve of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s party had escaped the battle,
run the gauntlet through the wood, and come alive to the
Moat House. But out of this dozen, three had been gravely
wounded: two at Risingham in the disorder of the rout, one
by John Amend-All&rsquo;s marksmen as he crossed the forest.
This raised the force of the garrison, counting Hatch, Sir
Daniel, and young Shelton, to twenty-two effective men.
And more might be continually expected to arrive. The
danger lay not, therefore, in the lack of men.</p>

<p>It was the terror of the Black Arrow that oppressed the
spirits of the garrison. For their open foes of the party of
York, in these most changing times, they felt but a far-away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
concern. &ldquo;The world,&rdquo; as people said in those days,
&ldquo;might change again&rdquo; before harm came. But for their
neighbours in the wood they trembled. It was not Sir
Daniel alone who was a mark for hatred. His men, conscious
of impunity, had carried themselves cruelly through all the
country. Harsh commands had been harshly executed;
and of the little band that now sat talking in the court,
there was not one but had been guilty of some act of oppression
or barbarity. And now, by the fortune of war, Sir
Daniel had become powerless to protect his instruments;
now, by the issue of some hours of battle, at which many of
them had not been present, they had all become punishable
traitors to the State, outside the buckler of the law, a shrunken
company in a poor fortress that was hardly tenable, and
exposed upon all sides to the just resentment of their victims.
Nor had there been lacking grisly advertisements of what
they might expect.</p>

<p>At different periods of the evening and the night, no
fewer than seven riderless horses had come neighing in terror
to the gate. Two were from Selden&rsquo;s troop; five belonged
to men who had ridden with Sir Daniel to the field. Lastly,
a little before dawn, a spearman had come staggering to
the moat-side, pierced by three arrows; even as they carried
him in, his spirit had departed; but, by the words that he
uttered in his agony, he must have been the last survivor of
a considerable company of men.</p>

<p>Hatch himself showed, under his sun-brown, the pallor
of anxiety; and when he had taken Dick aside and learned
the fate of Selden, he fell on a stone bench and fairly wept.
The others, from where they sat on stools or doorsteps in
the sunny angle of the court, looked at him with wonder and
alarm, but none ventured to inquire the cause of his emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Master Shelton,&rdquo; said Hatch at last&mdash;&ldquo;nay,
but what said I? We shall all go. Selden was a man of
his hands; he was like a brother to me. Well, he has gone
second; well, we shall all follow! For what said their knave
rhyme?&mdash;&rsquo;A black arrow in each black heart.&rsquo; Was it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
so it went? Appleyard, Selden, Smith, old Humphrey
gone; and there lieth poor John Carter, crying, poor sinner,
for the priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick gave ear. Out of a low window, hard by where
they were talking, groans and murmurs came to his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lieth he there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, in the second porter&rsquo;s chamber,&rdquo; answered Hatch.
&ldquo;We could not bear him farther, soul and body were so
bitterly at odds. At every step we lifted him he thought
to wend. But now, methinks, it is the soul that suffereth.
Ever for the priest he crieth, and Sir Oliver, I wot not why,
still cometh not. &rsquo;Twill be a long shrift; but poor Appleyard
and poor Selden, they had none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick stooped to the window and looked in. The little
cell was low and dark, but he could make out the wounded
soldier lying moaning on his pallet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carter, poor friend, how goeth it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; returned the man, in an excited
whisper, &ldquo;for the dear light of heaven, bring the priest.
Alack, I am sped: I am brought very low down; my hurt
is to the death. Ye may do me no more service; this shall
be the last. Now, for my poor soul&rsquo;s interest, and as a loyal
gentleman, bestir you; for I have that matter on my conscience
that shall drag me deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He groaned, and Dick heard the grating of his teeth,
whether in pain or terror.</p>

<p>Just then Sir Daniel appeared upon the threshold of the
hall. He had a letter in one hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have had a shog, we have had a
tumble; wherefore, then, deny it? Rather it imputeth
to get speedily again to saddle. This old Harry the Sixt
has had the undermost. Wash we, then, our hands of him.
I have a good friend that rideth next the duke, the Lord of
Wensleydale. Well, I have writ a letter to my friend,
praying his good lordship, and offering large satisfaction for
the past and reasonable surety for the future. Doubt not
but he will lend a favourable ear. A prayer without gifts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
is like a song without music: I surfeit him with promises,
boys&mdash;I spare not to promise. What, then, is lacking?
Nay, a great thing&mdash;wherefore should I deceive you?&mdash;a
great thing and a difficult: a messenger to bear it. The
woods&mdash;y&rsquo; are not ignorant of that&mdash;lie thick with our ill-willers.
Haste is most needful; but without sleight and
caution all is naught. Which, then, of this company will
take me this letter, bear it to my Lord of Wensleydale, and
bring me the answer back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One man instantly arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, an&rsquo;t like you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I will even risk my
carcass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Dicky Bowyer, not so,&rdquo; returned the knight.
&ldquo;It likes me not. Y&rsquo; are sly indeed, but not speedy. Ye
were a laggard ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t be so, Sir Daniel, here am I,&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saints forfend!&rdquo; said the knight. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are
speedy, but not sly. Ye would blunder me headforemost
into John Amend-All&rsquo;s camp. I thank you both for your
good courage; but, in sooth, it may not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hatch offered himself, and he also was refused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you here, good Bennet; y&rsquo; are my right hand,
indeed,&rdquo; returned the knight; and then, several coming
forward in a group, Sir Daniel at length selected one and
gave him the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;upon your good speed and better
discretion we do all depend. Bring me a good answer back,
and before three weeks I will have purged my forest of these
vagabonds that brave us to our faces. But mark it well,
Throgmorton: the matter is not easy. Ye must steal forth
under night, and go like a fox; and how ye are to cross Till
I know not, neither by the bridge nor ferry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can swim,&rdquo; returned Throgmorton. &ldquo;I will come
soundly, fear not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, friend, get ye to the buttery,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel.
&ldquo;Ye shall swim first of all in nut-brown ale.&rdquo; And with
that he turned back into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
&ldquo;Sir Daniel hath a wise tongue,&rdquo; said Hatch aside to Dick.
&ldquo;See, now, where many a lesser man had glossed the matter
over, he speaketh it out plainly to his company. Here is
a danger, &rsquo;a saith, and here difficulty; and jesteth in the
very saying. Nay, by St. Barbary, he is a born captain!
Not a man but he is some deal heartened up! See how
they fall again to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This praise of Sir Daniel put a thought in the lad&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bennet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how came my father by his end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask me not that,&rdquo; replied Hatch. &ldquo;I had no hand
nor knowledge in it; furthermore, I will even be silent,
Master Dick. For look you, in a man&rsquo;s own business there he
may speak; but of hearsay matters and of common talk, not
so. Ask me Sir Oliver&mdash;ay, or Carter, if ye will; not me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hatch set off to make the rounds, leaving Dick in a
muse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore would he not tell me?&rdquo; thought the lad.
&ldquo;And wherefore named he Carter? Carter&mdash;nay, then
Carter had a hand in it, perchance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He entered the house, and passing some little way along
a flagged and vaulted passage, came to the door of the cell
where the hurt man lay groaning. At his entrance, Carter
started eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye brought the priest?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet awhile,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; have a word
to tell me first. How came my father, Harry Shelton, by
his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s face altered instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; he replied doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, ye know well,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Seek not to
put me by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I know not,&rdquo; repeated Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;ye shall die unshriven. Here
am I, and here shall stay. There shall no priest come near
you, rest assured. For of what avail is penitence, an ye
have no mind to right those wrongs ye had a hand in? and
without penitence, confession is but mockery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
&ldquo;Ye say what ye mean not, Master Dick,&rdquo; said Carter
composedly. &ldquo;It is ill threatening the dying, and becometh
you (to speak truth) little. And for as little as it
commends you, it shall serve you less. Stay an ye please.
Ye will condemn my soul&mdash;ye shall learn nothing! There
is my last word to you.&rdquo; And the wounded man turned
upon the other side.</p>

<p>Now Dick, to say truth, had spoken hastily, and was
ashamed of his threat. But he made one more effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mistake me not. I know ye were
but an instrument in the hands of others; a churl must obey
his lord; I would not bear heavily on such an one. But I
begin to learn upon many sides that this great duty lieth on
my youth and ignorance, to avenge my father. Prithee,
then, good Carter, set aside the memory of my threatenings,
and in pure good-will and honest penitence, give me a word
of help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wounded man lay silent; nor, say what Dick pleased,
could he extract another word from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I will go call the priest to you as ye
desired; for howsoever ye be in fault to me or mine, I would
not be willingly in fault to any, least of all to one upon the
last change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the old soldier heard him without speech or motion;
even his groans he had suppressed; and as Dick turned and
left the room, he was filled with admiration for that rugged
fortitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;of what use is courage without
wit? Had his hands been clean, he would have spoken; his
silence did confess the secret louder than words. Nay, upon
all sides, proof floweth on me. Sir Daniel, he or his men,
hath done this thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick paused in the stone passage with a heavy heart.
At that hour, in the ebb of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s fortune, when he was
beleaguered by the archers of the Black Arrow, and proscribed
by the victorious Yorkists, was Dick, also, to turn
upon the man who had nourished and taught him, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
severely punished, indeed, but yet unwearyingly protected
his youth? The necessity, if it should prove to be one, was
cruel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray Heaven he be innocent!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>And then steps sounded on the flagging, and Sir Oliver
came gravely towards the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One seeketh you earnestly,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am upon the way, good Richard,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;It is this poor Carter. Alack, he is beyond cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet his soul is sicker than his body,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye seen him?&rdquo; asked Sir Oliver, with a manifest
start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do but come from him,&rdquo; replied Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What said he&mdash;what said he?&rdquo; snapped the priest,
with extraordinary eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He but cried for you the more piteously, Sir Oliver.
It were well done to go the faster, for his hurt is grievous,&rdquo;
returned the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am straight for him,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Well, we
have all our sins. We must all come to our latter day, good
Richard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir; and it were well if we all came fairly,&rdquo;
answered Dick.</p>

<p>The priest dropped his eyes, and with an inaudible
benediction hurried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He too!&rdquo; thought Dick&mdash;&ldquo;he, that taught me in
piety! Nay, then, what a world is this, if all that care for
me be blood-guilty of my father&rsquo;s death! Vengeance!
Alas! what a sore fate is mine, if I must be avenged upon my
friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought put Matcham in his head. He smiled at
the remembrance of his strange companion, and then
wondered where he was. Ever since they had come together
to the doors of the Moat House the younger lad had
disappeared, and Dick began to weary for a word with him.</p>

<p>About an hour after, mass being somewhat hastily run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
through by Sir Oliver, the company gathered in the hall for
dinner. It was a long, low apartment, strewn with green
rushes, and the walls hung with arras in a design of savage
men and questing bloodhounds; here and there hung spears
and bows and bucklers; a fire blazed in the big chimney;
there were arras-covered benches round the wall, and in the
midst the table, fairly spread, awaited the arrival of the
diners. Neither Sir Daniel nor his lady made their appearance.
Sir Oliver himself was absent, and here again there
was no word of Matcham. Dick began to grow alarmed, to
recall his companion&rsquo;s melancholy forebodings, and to
wonder to himself if any foul play had befallen him in that
house.</p>

<p>After dinner he found Goody Hatch, who was hurrying
to my lady Brackley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goody,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where is Master Matcham, I prithee?
I saw ye go in with him when we arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Master Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have a famous bright
eye in your head, to be sure!&rdquo; and laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but where is he, indeed?&rdquo; persisted Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye will never see him more,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;never.
It is sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An I do not,&rdquo; returned the lad, &ldquo;I will know the
reason why. He came not hither of his full free will; such
as I am, I am his best protector, and I will see him justly
used. There be too many mysteries; I do begin to weary
of the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as Dick was speaking, a heavy hand fell on his
shoulder. It was Bennet Hatch that had come unperceived
behind him. With a jerk of his thumb, the retainer dismissed
his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend Dick,&rdquo; he said, as soon as they were alone,
&ldquo;are ye a moonstruck natural? An ye leave not certain
things in peace, ye were better in the salt sea than here in
Tunstall Moat House. Y&rsquo; have questioned me; y&rsquo; have
baited Carter; y&rsquo; have frighted the jack-priest with hints.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
Bear ye more wisely, fool; and even now, when Sir Daniel
calleth you, show me a smooth face, for the love of wisdom.
Y&rsquo; are to be sharply questioned. Look to your answers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hatch,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;in all this I smell a guilty
conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ye go not the wiser, ye will soon smell blood,&rdquo; replied
Bennet. &ldquo;I do but warn you. And here cometh one
to call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And indeed, at that very moment, a messenger came
across the court to summon Dick into the presence of Sir
Daniel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>THE TWO OATHS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Sir Daniel</span> was in the hall; there he paced angrily before
the fire, awaiting Dick&rsquo;s arrival. None was by except Sir
Oliver, and he sat discreetly backward, thumbing and
muttering over his breviary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; have sent for me, Sir Daniel?&rdquo; said young Shelton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent for you, indeed,&rdquo; replied the knight.
&ldquo;For what cometh to mine ears? Have I been to you so
heavy a guardian that ye make haste to credit ill of me?
Or sith that ye see me, for the nonce, some worsted, do ye
think to quit my party? By the mass, your father was not
so! Those he was near, those he stood by, come wind or
weather. But you, Dick, y&rsquo; are a fair-day friend, it seemeth,
and now seek to clear yourself of your allegiance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please you, Sir Daniel, not so,&rdquo; returned Dick
firmly. &ldquo;I am grateful and faithful, where gratitude and
faith are due. And before more is said, I thank you, and
I thank Sir Oliver; y&rsquo; have great claims upon me, both&mdash;none
can have more; I were a hound if I forgot
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel; and then, rising into anger:
&ldquo;Gratitude and faith are words, Dick Shelton,&rdquo; he continued;
&ldquo;but I look to deeds. In this hour of my peril
when my name is attainted, when my lands are forfeit, when
this wood is full of men that hunger and thirst for my destruction,
what doth gratitude? what doth faith? I have
but a little company remaining; is it grateful or faithful to
poison me their hearts with your insidious whisperings?
Save me from such gratitude! But come, now, what is it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
ye wish? Speak; we are here to answer. If ye have aught
against me, stand forth and say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;my father fell when I was yet a
child. It hath come to mine ears that he was foully done by.
It hath come to mine ears&mdash;for I will not dissemble&mdash;that
ye had a hand in his undoing. And in all verity,&mdash;I shall
not be at peace in mine own mind, nor very clear to help you,
till I have certain resolution of these doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Daniel sat down in a deep settle. He took his chin
in his hand and looked at Dick fixedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ye think I would be guardian to the man&rsquo;s son
that I had murdered?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;pardon me if I answer churlishly;
but indeed ye know right well a wardship is most profitable.
All these years have ye not enjoyed my revenues, and led
my men? Have ye not still my marriage? I wot not what
it may be worth&mdash;it is worth something. Pardon me again;
but if ye were base enough to slay a man under trust, here
were, perhaps, reasons enough to move you to the lesser
baseness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a lad of your years,&rdquo; returned Sir Daniel
sternly, &ldquo;my mind had not so turned upon suspicions. And
Sir Oliver here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;why should he, a priest, be
guilty of this act?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;but where the master
biddeth there will the dog go. It is well known this priest is
but your instrument. I speak very freely; the time is not
for courtesies. Even as I speak, so would I be answered.
And answer get I none! Ye but put more questions. I
rede ye beware, Sir Daniel; for in this way ye will but
nourish and not satisfy my doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will answer you fairly, Master Richard,&rdquo; said the
knight. &ldquo;Were I to pretend ye have not stirred my wrath,
I were no honest man. But I will be just even in anger.
Come to me with these words when y&rsquo; are grown and come
to man&rsquo;s estate, and I am no longer your guardian, and so
helpless to resent them. Come to me then, and I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
answer you as ye merit, with a buffet in the mouth. Till
then ye have two courses: either swallow me down these
insults, keep a silent tongue, and fight in the meanwhile for
the man that fed and fought for your infancy; or else&mdash;the
door standeth open, the woods are full of mine enemies&mdash;go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spirit with which these words were uttered, the
looks with which they were accompanied, staggered Dick;
and yet he could not but observe that he had got no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire nothing more earnestly, Sir Daniel, than to
believe you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Assure me ye are free from this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye take my word of honour, Dick?&rdquo; inquired the
knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would I,&rdquo; answered the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give it you,&rdquo; returned Sir Daniel. &ldquo;Upon my word
of honour, upon the eternal welfare of my spirit, and as I
shall answer for my deeds hereafter, I had no hand nor
portion in your father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He extended his hand, and Dick took it eagerly. Neither
of them observed the priest, who, at the pronunciation of
that solemn and false oath, had half arisen from his seat in
an agony of horror and remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;ye must find it in your great-heartedness
to pardon me! I was a churl indeed to doubt of you.
But ye have my hand upon it; I will doubt no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Dick,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are forgiven.
Ye know not the world and its calumnious nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the more to blame,&rdquo; added Dick, &ldquo;in that the
rogues pointed, not directly at yourself, but at Sir Oliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned towards the priest, and paused in
the middle of the last word. This tall, ruddy, corpulent,
high-stepping man had fallen, you might say, to pieces; his
colour was gone, his limbs were relaxed, his lips stammered
prayers; and now, when Dick&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon him
suddenly, he cried out aloud, like some wild animal, and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel was by him in two strides, and shook him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
fiercely by the shoulder. At the same moment Dick&rsquo;s
suspicions re-awakened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Sir Oliver may swear also. &rsquo;Twas
him they accused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall swear,&rdquo; said the knight.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver speechlessly waved his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, by the mass! but ye shall swear,&rdquo; cried Sir Daniel,
beside himself with fury. &ldquo;Here, upon this book, ye shall
swear,&rdquo; he continued, picking up the breviary, which had
fallen to the ground. &ldquo;What! Ye make me doubt you!
Swear, I say; swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the priest was still incapable of speech. His terror
of Sir Daniel, his terror of perjury, risen to about an equal
height, strangled him.</p>

<p>And just then, through the high stained-glass window
of the hall, a black arrow crashed, and struck, and stuck
quivering in the midst of the long table.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver, with a loud scream, fell fainting on the rushes;
while the knight, followed by Dick, dashed into the court
and up the nearest corkscrew stair to the battlements. The
sentries were all on the alert. The sun shone quietly on green
lawns dotted with trees, and on the wooded hills of the forest
which enclosed the view. There was no sign of a besieger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whence came that shot?&rdquo; asked the knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From yonder clump, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; returned a sentinel.</p>

<p>The knight stood a little, musing. Then he turned to
Dick. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep me an eye upon these men;
I leave you in charge here. As for the priest, he shall clear
himself, or I will know the reason why. I do almost begin
to share in your suspicions. He shall swear, trust me, or
we shall prove him guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick answered somewhat coldly, and the knight, giving
him a piercing glance, hurriedly returned to the hall. His
first glance was for the arrow. It was the first of these
missiles he had seen, and as he turned it to and fro, the dark
hue of it touched him with some fear. Again there was some
writing: one word&mdash;&ldquo;Earthed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;they know I am home, then.
Earthed! Ay, but there is not a dog among them fit to dig
me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver had come to himself, and now scrambled to
his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alack, Sir Daniel!&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have sworn a
dread oath; y&rsquo; are doomed to the end of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned the knight, &ldquo;I have sworn an oath,
indeed, thou chucklehead; but thyself shalt swear a greater.
It shall be on the blessed cross of Holywood. Look to it;
get the words ready. It shall be sworn to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, may Heaven lighten you!&rdquo; replied the priest;
&ldquo;may Heaven incline your heart from this iniquity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you, my good father,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel, &ldquo;if y&rsquo;
are for piety, I say no more; ye begin late, that is all. But
if y&rsquo; are in any sense bent upon wisdom, hear me. This
lad beginneth to irk me like a wasp. I have a need for him,
for I would sell his marriage. But I tell you, in all plainness,
if that he continue to weary me he shall go join his father. I
give orders now to change him to the chamber above the
chapel. If that ye can swear your innocency with a good
solid oath and an assured countenance, it is well; the lad
will be at peace a little, and I will spare him. If that ye
stammer or blench, or anyways boggle at the swearing, he
will not believe you; and, by the mass, he shall die. There
is for your thinking on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chamber above the chapel!&rdquo; gasped the priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same,&rdquo; replied the knight. &ldquo;So if ye desire to
save him, save him; and if ye desire not, prithee, go to, and
let me be at peace! For an I had been a hasty man I would
already have put my sword through you, for your intolerable
cowardice and folly. Have ye chosen? Say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have chosen,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Heaven pardon me,
I will do evil for good. I will swear for the lad&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is best!&rdquo; said Sir Daniel. &ldquo;Send for him, then,
speedily. Ye shall see him alone. Yet I shall have an eye
on you. I shall be here in the panel room.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span></p>

<p>The knight raised the arras and let it fall again behind
him. There was the sound of a spring opening; then
followed the creaking of trod stairs.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver, left alone, cast a timorous glance upward at
the arras-covered wall, and crossed himself with every
appearance of terror and contrition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, if he is in the chapel room,&rdquo; the priest murmured,
&ldquo;were it at my soul&rsquo;s cost, I must save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three minutes later, Dick, who had been summoned by
another messenger, found Sir Oliver standing by the hall
table, resolute and pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard Shelton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye have required an oath
from me. I might complain, I might deny you; but my
heart is moved toward you for the past, and I will even content
you as ye choose. By the true cross of Holywood, I
did not slay your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Oliver,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;when first we read John
Amend-All&rsquo;s paper I was convinced of so much. But suffer
me to put two questions. Ye did not slay him; granted.
But had ye no hand in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Sir Oliver. And at the same time he began
to contort his face, and signal with his mouth and eyebrows,
like one who desired to convey a warning, yet dared not
utter a sound.</p>

<p>Dick regarded him in wonder; then he turned and looked
all about him at the empty hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What make ye?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, naught,&rdquo; returned the priest, hastily smoothing
his countenance. &ldquo;I make naught; I do but suffer; I am
sick. I&mdash;I&mdash;prithee, Dick, I must begone. On the true
cross of Holywood, I am clean innocent alike of violence or
treachery. Content ye, good lad. Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he made his escape from the apartment with unusual
alacrity.</p>

<p>Dick remained rooted to the spot, his eyes wandering
about the room, his face a changing picture of various
emotions, wonder, doubt, suspicion, and amusement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
Gradually, as his mind grew clearer, suspicion took the upper
hand, and was succeeded by certainty of the worst. He
raised his head, and, as he did so, violently started. High
upon the wall there was the figure of a savage hunter woven
in the tapestry. With one hand he held a horn to his mouth;
in the other he brandished a stout spear. His face was dark,
for he was meant to represent an African.</p>

<p>Now, here was what had startled Richard Shelton. The
sun had moved away from the hall windows, and at the same
time the fire had blazed up high on the wide hearth, and shed
a changeful glow upon the roof and hangings. In this light
the figure of the black hunter had winked at him with a
white eyelid.</p>

<p>He continued staring at the eye. The light shone upon
it like a gem; it was liquid, it was alive. Again the white
eyelid closed upon it for a fraction of a second, and the next
moment it was gone.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake. The live eye that had been
watching him through a hole in the tapestry was gone.
The firelight no longer shone on a reflecting surface.</p>

<p>And instantly Dick awoke to the terrors of his position.
Hatch&rsquo;s warning, the mute signals of the priest, this eye that
had observed him from the wall, ran together in his mind.
He saw he had been put upon his trial, that he had once more
betrayed his suspicions, and that, short of some miracle, he
was lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I cannot get me forth out of this house,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;I am a dead man! And this poor Matcham, too&mdash;to what
a cockatrice&rsquo;s nest have I not led him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was still so thinking, when there came one in haste,
to bid him help in changing his arms, his clothing, and his
two or three books, to a new chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new chamber?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Wherefore so?
What chamber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis one above the chapel,&rdquo; answered the messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hath stood long empty,&rdquo; said Dick, musing. &ldquo;What
manner of room is it?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, a brave room,&rdquo; returned the man. &ldquo;But yet&rdquo;&mdash;lowering
his voice&mdash;&ldquo;they call it haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haunted?&rdquo; repeated Dick, with a chill. &ldquo;I have
not heard of it. Nay, then, and by whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The messenger looked about him; and then, in a low
whisper, &ldquo;By the sacrist of St. John&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
had him there to sleep one night, and in the morning&mdash;whew!&mdash;he
was gone. The devil had taken him, they said;
the more betoken, he had drunk late the night before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick followed the man with black forebodings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE ROOM OVER THE CHAPEL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">From</span> the battlements nothing further was observed. The
sun journeyed westward, and at last went down; but to the
eyes of all these eager sentinels no living thing appeared in
the neighbourhood of Tunstall House.</p>

<p>When the night was at length fairly come, Throgmorton
was led to a room overlooking an angle of the moat. Thence
he was lowered with every precaution; the ripple of his
swimming was audible for a brief period; then a black figure
was observed to land by the branches of a willow and crawl
away among the grass. For some half-hour Sir Daniel and
Hatch stood eagerly giving ear; but all remained quiet.
The messenger had got away in safety.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel&rsquo;s brow grew clearer. He turned to Hatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bennet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this John Amend-All is no more
than a man ye see. He sleepeth. We will make a good
end of him, go to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the afternoon and evening Dick had been ordered
hither and thither, one command following another, till he
was bewildered with the number and the hurry of commissions.
All that time he had seen no more of Sir Oliver,
and nothing of Matcham; and yet both the priest and the
young lad ran continually in his mind. It was now his chief
purpose to escape from Tunstall Moat House as speedily as
might be; and yet before he went, he desired a word with
both of these.</p>

<p>At length, with a lamp in one hand, he mounted to his
new apartment. It was large, low, and somewhat dark.
The window looked upon the moat, and although it was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
high up, it was heavily barred. The bed was luxurious,
with one pillow of down, and one of lavender, and a red
coverlet worked in a pattern of roses. All about the walls
were cupboards, locked and padlocked, and concealed from
view by hangings of dark-coloured arras. Dick made the
round, lifting the arras, sounding the panels, seeking vainly
to open the cupboards. He assured himself that the door
was strong, and the bolt solid; then he set down his lamp
upon a bracket, and once more looked all around.</p>

<p>For what reason had he been given this chamber? It
was larger and finer than his own. Could it conceal a snare?
Was there a secret entrance? Was it indeed haunted? His
blood ran a little chilly in his veins.</p>

<p>Immediately over him the heavy foot of a sentry trod
the leads. Below, he knew, was the arched roof of the
chapel; and next to the chapel was the hall. Certainly
there was a secret passage in the hall; the eye that had
watched him from the arras gave him proof of that. Was it
not more than probable that the passage extended to the
chapel, and, if so, that it had an opening in his room?</p>

<p>To sleep in such a place, he felt, would be foolhardy.
He made his weapons ready, and took his position in a corner
of the room behind the door. If ill was intended, he would
sell his life dear.</p>

<p>The sound of many feet, the challenge, and the pass-word
sounded overhead along the battlements; the watch was
being changed.</p>

<p>And just then there came a scratching at the door of
the chamber; it grew a little louder; then a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick, Dick, it is I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick ran to the door, drew the bolt and admitted
Matcham. He was very pale, and carried a lamp in one
hand and a drawn dagger in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut me the door,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Swift, Dick!
This house is full of spies; I hear their feet follow me in the
corridors; I hear them breathe behind the arras.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, content you,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;it is closed. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
are safe for this while, if there be safety anywhere within
these walls. But my heart is glad to see you. By the mass,
lad, I thought ye were sped. Where hid ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters not,&rdquo; returned Matcham. &ldquo;Since we be
met, it matters not. But, Dick, are your eyes open? Have
they told you of to-morrow&rsquo;s doings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;What make they to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, or to-night, I know not,&rdquo; said the other;
&ldquo;but one time or other, Dick, they do intend upon your life.
I had the proof of it: I have heard them whisper; nay, they
as good as told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;is it so? I had thought as
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he told him the day&rsquo;s occurrences at length.</p>

<p>When it was done, Matcham arose and began, in turn,
to examine the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no entrance visible. Yet &rsquo;tis
a pure certainty there is one. Dick, I will stay by you.
An y&rsquo; are to die, I will die with you. And I can help&mdash;look!
I have stolen a dagger&mdash;I will do my best! And
meanwhile, an ye know of any issue, any sally-port we
could get opened, or any window that we might descend by,
I will most joyfully face any jeopardy to flee with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;by the mass, Jack, y&rsquo; are the best
soul, and the truest, and the bravest in all England. Give
me your hand, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he grasped the other&rsquo;s hand in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;There is a window
out of which the messenger descended; the rope should still
be in the chamber. &rsquo;Tis a hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>Both gave ear. There was a sound below the floor;
then it paused, and then began again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one walketh in the room below,&rdquo; whispered
Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;there is no room below; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
are above the chapel. It is my murderer in the secret passage.
Well, let him come: it shall go hard with him!&rdquo;
And he ground his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow me the lights out,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Perchance
he will betray himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They blew out both the lamps and lay still as death.
The footfalls underneath were very soft, but they were
clearly audible. Several times they came and went; and
then there was a loud jar of a key turning in a lock, followed
by a considerable silence.</p>

<p>Presently the steps began again, and then, all of a sudden,
a chink of light appeared in the planking of the room in a
far corner. It widened; a trap-door was being opened,
letting in a gush of light. They could see the strong hand
pushing it up; and Dick raised his crossbow, waiting for the
head to follow.</p>

<p>But now there came an interruption. From a distant
corner of the Moat House shouts began to be heard, and first
one voice, and then several, crying aloud upon a name.
This noise had plainly disconcerted the murderer, for the
trap-door was silently lowered to its place, and the steps
hurriedly returned, passed once more close below the lads,
and died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Here was a moment&rsquo;s respite. Dick breathed deep,
and then, and not till then, he gave ear to the disturbance
which had interrupted the attack, and which was now
rather increasing than diminishing. All about the Moat
House feet were running, doors were opening and slamming,
and still the voice of Sir Daniel towered above all this bustle,
shouting for &ldquo;Joanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joanna!&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;Why, who the murrain
should this be? Here is no Joanna, nor ever hath been.
What meaneth it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matcham was silent. He seemed to have drawn farther
away. But only a little faint starlight entered by the
window, and at the far end of the apartment where the pair
were, the darkness was complete.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I wot not where ye were all day.
Saw ye this Joanna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Matcham, &ldquo;I saw her not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor heard tell of her?&rdquo; he pursued.</p>

<p>The steps drew nearer. Sir Daniel was still roaring the
name of Joanna from the courtyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye hear of her?&rdquo; repeated Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard of her,&rdquo; said Matcham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How your voice twitters! What aileth you?&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a most excellent good fortune, this Joanna;
it will take their minds from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; cried Matcham, &ldquo;I am lost; we are both lost!
Let us flee if there be yet time. They will not rest till they
have found me. Or, see! let me go forth; when they have
found me, ye may flee. Let me forth, Dick; good Dick,
let me away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was groping for the bolt, when Dick at last comprehended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are no Jack; y&rsquo; are
Joanna Sedley; y&rsquo; are the maid that would not marry
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl paused, and stood silent and motionless. Dick,
too, was silent for a little; then he spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joanna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have saved my life, and I have
saved yours; and we have seen blood flow, and been friends
and enemies&mdash;ay, and I took my belt to thrash you; and
all that time I thought ye were a boy. But now death has
me, and my time&rsquo;s out, and before I die I must say this:
Y&rsquo; are the best maid and the bravest under heaven, and, if
only I could live, I would marry you blithely; and, live or
die, I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;speak up, Jack. Come, be a good
maid, and say ye love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;would I be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, see ye here,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;an we but escape
whole, we&rsquo;ll marry; and an we&rsquo;re to die, we die, and there&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
an end on&rsquo;t. But now that I think, how found ye my
chamber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked it of Dame Hatch,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the dame&rsquo;s staunch,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
not tell upon you. We have time before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just then, as if to contradict his words, feet came
down the corridor, and a fist beat roughly on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried a voice. &ldquo;Open, Master Dick; open!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick neither moved nor answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; said the girl; and she put her arms about
Dick&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>One after another, men came trooping to the door. Then
Sir Daniel arrived himself, and there was a sudden cessation
of the noise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; cried the knight, &ldquo;be not an ass. The Seven
Sleepers had been awake ere now. We know she is within
there. Open, then, the door, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was again silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with it,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel. And immediately
his followers fell savagely upon the door with foot and fist.
Solid as it was, and strongly bolted, it would soon have given
way, but once more fortune interfered. Over the thunder-storm
of blows the cry of a sentinel was heard: it was followed
by another: shouts ran along the battlements, shouts answered
out of the wood. In the first moment of alarm it
sounded as if the foresters were carrying the Moat House by
assault. And Sir Daniel and his men, desisting instantly
from their attack upon Dick&rsquo;s chamber, hurried to defend
the walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;we are saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seized the great old bedstead with both hands, and
bent himself in vain to move it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me, Jack. For your life&rsquo;s sake, help me stoutly!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>Between them, with a huge effort, they dragged the big
frame of oak across the room, and thrust it endwise to the
chamber door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye do but make things worse,&rdquo; said Joanna sadly.
&ldquo;He will then enter by the trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;He durst not tell his secret
to so many. It is by the trap that we shall flee. Hark!
The attack is over. Nay, it was none!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had, indeed, been no attack; it was the arrival of
another party of stragglers from the defeat of Risingham
that had disturbed Sir Daniel. They had run the gauntlet
under cover of the darkness; they had been admitted by
the great gate; and now, with a great stamping of hoofs and
jingle of accoutrements and arms they were dismounting
in the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will return anon,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;To the trap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lighted a lamp, and they went together into the
corner of the room. The open chink through which some
light still glittered was easily discovered, and, taking a stout
sword from his small armoury, Dick thrust it deep into the
seam, and weighed strenuously on the hilt. The trap moved,
gaped a little, and at length came widely open. Seizing it
with their hands, the two young folk threw it back. It
disclosed a few steps descending, and at the foot of them,
where the would-be murderer had left it, a burning lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;go first and take the lamp. I will
follow to close the trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they descended one after the other, and as Dick
lowered the trap the blows began once again to thunder on
the panels of the door.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE PASSAGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> passage in which Dick and Joanna now found themselves
was narrow, dirty, and short. At the other end of it,
a door stood partly open; the same door, without doubt,
that they had heard the man unlocking. Heavy cobwebs
hung from the roof, and the paved flooring echoed hollow
under the lightest tread.</p>

<p>Beyond the door there were two branches, at right angles.
Dick chose one of them at random, and the pair hurried,
with echoing footsteps, along the hollow of the chapel roof.
The top of the arched ceiling rose like a whale&rsquo;s back in the
dim glimmer of the lamp. Here and there were spy-holes,
concealed, on the other side, by the carving of the cornice;
and looking down through one of these, Dick saw the paved
floor of the chapel&mdash;the altar, with its burning tapers&mdash;and,
stretched before it on the steps, the figure of Sir Oliver praying
with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>At the other end they descended a few steps. The
passage grew narrower; the wall upon one hand was now
of wood; the noise of people talking, and a faint flickering
of lights, came through the interstices; and presently they
came to a round hole about the size of a man&rsquo;s eye, and Dick,
looking down through it, beheld the interior of the hall, and
some half a dozen men sitting, in their jacks, about the table,
drinking deep and demolishing a venison pie. These were
certainly some of the late arrivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is no help,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Let us try back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Joanna; &ldquo;maybe the passage goeth farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she pushed on. But a few yards farther the passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
ended at the top of a short flight of steps; and it became
plain that, as long as the soldiers occupied the hall, escape
was impossible upon that side.</p>

<p>They retraced their steps with all imaginable speed, and
set forward to explore the other branch. It was exceedingly
narrow, scarce wide enough for a large man; and it led them
continually up and down by little break-neck stairs, until
even Dick had lost all notion of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>At length it grew both narrower and lower; the stairs
continued to descend; the walls on either hand became damp
and slimy to the touch; and far in front of them they heard
the squeaking and scuttling of the rats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be in the dungeons,&rdquo; Dick remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And still there is no outlet,&rdquo; added Joanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but an outlet there must be!&rdquo; Dick answered.</p>

<p>Presently, sure enough, they came to a sharp angle, and
then the passage ended in a flight of steps. On the top of
that there was a solid flag of stone by way of trap, and to
this they both set their backs. It was immovable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one holdeth it,&rdquo; suggested Joanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;for were a man strong as ten,
he must still yield a little. But this resisteth like dead rock.
There is a weight upon the trap. Here is no issue; and, by
my sooth, good Jack, we are here as fairly prisoners as though
the gyves were on our ankle-bones. Sit ye then down, and
let us talk. After a while we shall return, when perchance
they shall be less carefully upon their guard; and, who
knoweth? we may break out and stand a chance. But, in
my poor opinion, we are as good as shent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;alas the day that ever ye should
have seen me! For like a most unhappy and unthankful
maid, it is I have led you hither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer!&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;It was all written,
and that which is written, willy nilly, cometh still to pass.
But tell me a little what manner of a maid ye are, and how
ye came into Sir Daniel&rsquo;s hands; that will do better than to
bemoan yourself, whether for your sake or mine.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an orphan, like yourself, of father and mother,&rdquo;
said Joanna; &ldquo;and for my great misfortune, Dick, and
hitherto for yours, I am a rich marriage. My Lord Foxham
had me to ward; yet it appears Sir Daniel bought the
marriage of me from the king, and a right dear price he paid
for it. So here was I, poor babe, with two great and rich
men fighting which should marry me, and I still at nurse!
Well, then, the world changed, and there was a new chancellor,
and Sir Daniel bought the warding of me over the Lord
Foxham&rsquo;s head. And then the world changed again, and
Lord Foxham bought my marriage over Sir Daniel&rsquo;s; and
from then to now it went on ill betwixt the two of them.
But still Lord Foxham kept me in his hands, and was a
good lord to me. And at last I was to be married&mdash;or sold,
if ye like it better. Five hundred pounds Lord Foxham
was to get for me. Hamley was the groom&rsquo;s name, and to-morrow,
Dick, of all days in the year, was I to be betrothed.
Had it not come to Sir Daniel, I had been wedded, sure&mdash;and
never seen thee, Dick, dear Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here she took his hand, and kissed it, with the
prettiest grace; and Dick drew her hand to him and did the
like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;Sir Daniel took me unawares
in the garden, and made me dress in these men&rsquo;s clothes,
which is a deadly sin for a woman; and, besides, they fit
me not. He rode with me to Kettley, as ye saw, telling me
I was to marry you; but I, in my heart, made sure I would
marry Hamley in his teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;and so ye loved this Hamley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Joanna, &ldquo;not I. I did but hate Sir
Daniel. And then, Dick, ye helped me, and ye were right
kind, and very bold, and my heart turned towards you in
mine own despite; and now, if we can in any way compass
it, I would marry you with right goodwill. And if, by cruel
destiny, it may not be, still ye&rsquo;ll be dear to me. While my
heart beats, it&rsquo;ll be true to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;that never cared a straw for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
manner of woman until now, I took to you when I thought
ye were a boy. I had a pity to you, and knew not why.
When I would have belted you, the hand failed me. But
when ye owned ye were a maid, Jack&mdash;for still I will call you
Jack&mdash;I made sure ye were the maid for me. Hark!&rdquo; he
said, breaking off&mdash;&ldquo;one cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And indeed a heavy tread was now audible in the echoing
passage, and the rats again fled in armies.</p>

<p>Dick reconnoitred his position. The sudden turn gave
him a post of vantage. He could thus shoot in safety from
the cover of the wall. But it was plain the light was too
near him, and, running some way forward, he set down the
lamp in the middle of the passage, and then returned to
watch.</p>

<p>Presently, at the far end of the passage, Bennet hove in
sight. He seemed to be alone, and he carried in his hand a
burning torch, which made him the better mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand, Bennet!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Another step and
y&rsquo; are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So here ye are,&rdquo; returned Hatch, peering forward into
the darkness. &ldquo;I see you not. Aha! y&rsquo; have done wisely,
Dick; y&rsquo; have put your lamp before you. By my sooth,
but, though it was done to shoot my own knave body, I do
rejoice to see ye profit of my lessons! And now, what make
ye? what seek ye here? Why would ye shoot upon an old,
kind friend? And have ye the young gentlewoman there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Bennet, it is I should question and you answer,&rdquo;
replied Dick. &ldquo;Why am I in this jeopardy of my life?
Why do men come privily to slay me in my bed? Why
am I now fleeing in mine own guardian&rsquo;s strong house, and
from the friends that I have lived among and never injured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Dick, Master Dick,&rdquo; said Bennet, &ldquo;what told
I you? Y&rsquo; are brave, but the most uncrafty lad that I can
think upon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;I see you know all, and that
I am doomed indeed. It is well. Here, where I am, I stay.
Let Sir Daniel get me out if he be able!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span></p>

<p>Hatch was silent for a space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark ye,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I return to Sir Daniel, to tell
him where ye are, and how posted; for, in truth, it was to
that end he sent me. But you, if ye are no fool, had best
be gone ere I return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be gone!&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;I would be gone already
an I wist how. I cannot move the trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me your hand into the corner, and see what ye find
there,&rdquo; replied Bennet. &ldquo;Throgmorton&rsquo;s rope is still in the
brown chamber. Fare ye well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hatch, turning upon his heel, disappeared again
into the windings of the passage.</p>

<p>Dick instantly returned for his lamp, and proceeded to
act upon the hint. At one corner of the trap there was a
deep cavity in the wall. Pushing his arm into the aperture,
Dick found an iron bar, which he thrust vigorously upwards.
There followed a snapping noise, and the slab of stone instantly
started in its bed.</p>

<p>They were free of the passage. A little exercise of
strength easily raised the trap; and they came forth into
a vaulted chamber, opening on one hand upon the court,
where one or two fellows, with bare arms, were rubbing down
the horses of the last arrivals. A torch or two, each stuck
in an iron ring against the wall, changefully lit up the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>HOW DICK CHANGED SIDES</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Dick</span>, blowing out his lamp lest it should attract attention,
led the way upstairs and along the corridor. In the brown
chamber the rope had been made fast to the frame of an
exceeding heavy and ancient bed. It had not been detached,
and Dick, taking the coil to the window, began to lower it
slowly and cautiously into the darkness of the night. Joan
stood by; but as the rope lengthened, and still Dick continued
to pay it out, extreme fear began to conquer her
resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is it so deep? I may not essay it.
I should infallibly fall, good Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just at the delicate moment of the operations that
she spoke. Dick started: the remainder of the coil slipped
from his grasp, and the end fell with a splash into the moat.
Instantly, from the battlement above, the voice of a
sentinel cried, &ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A murrain!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We are paid now! Down
with you&mdash;take the rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she cried, recoiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ye cannot, no more can I,&rdquo; said Shelton. &ldquo;How
can I swim the moat without you? Do ye desert me, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;I cannot. The strength is gone
from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass, then, we are all shent!&rdquo; he shouted,
stamping with his foot; and then, hearing steps, he ran to
the room door and sought to close it.</p>

<p>Before he could shoot the bolt, strong arms were thrusting
it back upon him from the other side. He struggled for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
second; then, feeling himself overpowered, ran back to the
window. The girl had fallen against the wall in the embrasure
of the window; she was more than half insensible; and
when he tried to raise her in his arms, her body was limp and
unresponsive.</p>

<p>At the same moment the men who had forced the door
against him laid hold upon him. The first he poniarded at
a blow, and the others falling back for a second in some disorder,
he profited by the chance, bestrode the window-sill,
seized the cord in both hands, and let his body slip.</p>

<p>The cord was knotted, which made it the easier to descend;
but so furious was Dick&rsquo;s hurry, and so small his
experience of such gymnastics, that he span round and
round in mid-air like a criminal upon a gibbet, and now beat
his head, and now bruised his hands, against the rugged
stonework of the wall. The air roared in his ears; he saw
the stars overhead, and the reflected stars below him in the
moat, whirling like dead leaves before the tempest. And
then he lost hold and fell, and soused head over ears into the
icy water.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface his hand encountered the
rope, which, newly lightened of his weight, was swinging
wildly to and fro. There was a red glow overhead, and
looking up, he saw, by the light of several torches and a
cresset full of burning coals, the battlements lined with faces.
He saw the men&rsquo;s eyes turning hither and thither in quest of
him; but he was too far below, the light reached him not,
and they looked in vain.</p>

<p>And now he perceived that the rope was considerably too
long, and he began to struggle as well as he could towards
the other side of the moat, still keeping his head above water.
In this way he got much more than half-way over; indeed
the bank was almost within reach, before the rope began to
draw him back by its own weight. Taking his courage in
both hands, he left go and made a leap for the trailing sprays
of willow that had already, that same evening, helped Sir
Daniel&rsquo;s messenger to land. He went down, rose again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
sank a second time, and then his hand caught a branch,
and with the speed of thought he had dragged himself into
the thick of the tree and clung there, dripping and panting,
and still half uncertain of his escape.</p>

<p>But all this had not been done without a considerable
splashing, which had so far indicated his position to the men
along the battlements. Arrows and quarrels fell thick
around him in the darkness, like driving hail; and suddenly
a torch was thrown down&mdash;flared through the air in its swift
passage&mdash;stuck for a moment on the edge of the bank, where
it burned high and lit up its whole surroundings like a bonfire&mdash;and
then, in a good hour for Dick, slipped off, plumped
into the moat, and was instantly extinguished.</p>

<p>It had served its purpose. The marksmen had had time
to see the willow, and Dick ensconced among its boughs; and
though the lad instantly sprang higher up the bank and ran
for his life, he was yet not quick enough to escape a shot. An
arrow struck him in the shoulder, another grazed his head.</p>

<p>The pain of his wounds lent him wings; and he had no
sooner got upon the level than he took to his heels and ran
straight before him in the dark, without a thought for the
direction of his flight.</p>

<p>For a few steps missiles followed him, but these soon
ceased; and when at length he came to a halt and looked
behind, he was already a good way from the Moat House,
though he could still see the torches moving to and fro along
its battlements.</p>

<p>He leaned against a tree, streaming with blood and
water, bruised, wounded, and alone. For all that, he had
saved his life for that bout; and though Joanna remained
behind in the power of Sir Daniel, he neither blamed himself
for an accident that it had been beyond his power to prevent,
nor did he augur any fatal consequences to the girl herself.
Sir Daniel was cruel, but he was not likely to be cruel to a
young gentlewoman who had other protectors, willing and
able to bring him to account. It was more probable he
would make haste to marry her to some friend of his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Dick, &ldquo;between then and now I will
find me the means to bring that traitor under; for I think,
by the mass, that I be now absolved from any gratitude or
obligation; and when war is open, there is a fair chance for
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, here he was in a sore plight.</p>

<p>For some little way farther he struggled forward through
the forest; but what with the pain of his wounds, the darkness
of the night, and the extreme uneasiness and confusion
of his mind, he soon became equally unable to guide himself
or to continue to push through the close undergrowth, and
he was fain at length to sit down and lean his back against
a tree.</p>

<p>When he awoke from something betwixt sleep and
swooning, the grey of the morning had begun to take the
place of night. A little chilly breeze was bustling among
the trees, and as he still sat staring before him, only half
awake, he became aware of something dark that swung to
and fro among the branches, some hundred yards in front
of him. The progressive brightening of the day and the
return of his own senses at last enabled him to recognise the
object. It was a man hanging from the bough of a tall oak.
His head had fallen forward on his breast; but at every
stronger puff of wind his body span round and round, and
his legs and arms tossed, like some ridiculous plaything.</p>

<p>Dick clambered to his feet, and, staggering and leaning
on the tree-trunks as he went, drew near to this grim object.</p>

<p>The bough was perhaps twenty feet above the ground,
and the poor fellow had been drawn up so high by his
executioners that his boots swung clear above Dick&rsquo;s reach;
and as his hood had been drawn over his face, it was impossible
to recognise the man.</p>

<p>Dick looked about him right and left; and at last he
perceived that the other end of the cord had been made fast
to the trunk of a little hawthorn which grew, thick with
blossom, under the lofty arcade of the oak. With his dagger,
which alone remained to him of all his arms, young Shelton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
severed the rope, and instantly, with a dead thump, the
corpse fell in a heap upon the ground.</p>

<p>Dick raised the hood; it was Throgmorton, Sir Daniel&rsquo;s
messenger. He had not gone far upon his errand. A paper,
which had apparently escaped the notice of the men of the
Black Arrow, stuck from the bosom of his doublet, and Dick,
pulling it forth, found it was Sir Daniel&rsquo;s letter to Lord
Wensleydale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;if the world changes yet again,
I may have here the wherewithal to shame Sir Daniel&mdash;nay,
and perchance to bring him to the block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he put the paper in his own bosom, said a prayer
over the dead man, and set forth again through the
woods.</p>

<p>His fatigue and weakness increased; his ears sang, his
steps faltered, his mind at intervals failed him, so low had
he been brought by loss of blood. Doubtless he made many
deviations from his true path, but at last he came out upon
the high-road, not very far from Tunstall hamlet.</p>

<p>A rough voice bid him stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand?&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;By the mass, but I am
nearer falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he suited the action to the word, and fell all his
length upon the road.</p>

<p>Two men came forth out of the thicket, each in green
forest jerkin, each with long-bow and quiver and short
sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Lawless,&rdquo; said the younger of the two, &ldquo;it is
young Shelton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, this will be as good as bread to John Amend-All,&rdquo;
returned the other. &ldquo;Though, faith, he hath been to the
wars. Here is a tear in his scalp that must &rsquo;a&rsquo; cost him
many a good ounce of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; added Greensheve, &ldquo;is a hole in his shoulder
that must have pricked him well. Who hath done this,
think ye? If it be one of ours, he may all to prayer; Ellis
will give him a short shrift and a long rope.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with the cub,&rdquo; said Lawless. &ldquo;Clap him on my
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, when Dick had been hoisted to his shoulders,
and he had taken the lad&rsquo;s arms about his neck, and got a
firm hold of him, the ex-Grey Friar added&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep ye the post, brother Greensheve. I will on with
him by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Greensheve returned to his ambush on the wayside,
and Lawless trudged down the hill, whistling as he went,
with Dick, still in a dead faint, comfortably settled on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>The sun rose as he came out of the skirts of the wood and
saw Tunstall hamlet straggling up the opposite hill. All
seemed quiet, but a strong post of some half a score of
archers lay close by the bridge on either side of the road,
and, as soon as they perceived Lawless with his burden,
began to bestir themselves and set arrow to string like
vigilant sentries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo; cried the man in command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will Lawless, by the rood&mdash;ye know me as well as your
own hand,&rdquo; returned the outlaw contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the word, Lawless,&rdquo; returned the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Heaven lighten thee, thou great fool,&rdquo; replied
Lawless. &ldquo;Did I not tell it thee myself? But ye are all
mad for this playing at soldiers. When I am in the greenwood,
give me greenwood ways; and my word for this tide
is, &lsquo;A fig for all mock soldiery!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless, ye but show an ill example; give us the word,
fool jester,&rdquo; said the commander of the post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I had forgotten it?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ye had forgotten it&mdash;as I know y&rsquo; have not&mdash;by
the mass, I would clap an arrow into your big body,&rdquo; returned
the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, an y&rsquo; are so ill a jester,&rdquo; said Lawless, &ldquo;ye shall
have your word for me. &lsquo;Duckworth and Shelton&rsquo; is the
word; and here, to the illustration, is Shelton on my
shoulders, and to Duckworth do I carry him.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass, Lawless,&rdquo; said the sentry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is John?&rdquo; asked the Grey Friar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He holdeth a court, by the mass, and taketh rents as
to the manner born!&rdquo; cried another of the company.</p>

<p>So it proved. When Lawless got as far up the village
as the little inn, he found Ellis Duckworth surrounded by
Sir Daniel&rsquo;s tenants, and, by the right of his good company
of archers, coolly taking rents, and giving written receipts
in return for them. By the faces of the tenants, it was
plain how little this proceeding pleased them; for they
argued very rightly that they would simply have to pay
them twice.</p>

<p>As soon as he knew what had brought Lawless, Ellis
dismissed the remainder of the tenants, and, with every
mark of interest and apprehension, conducted Dick into
an inner chamber of the inn. There the lad&rsquo;s hurts were
looked to; and he was recalled, by simple remedies, to
consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear lad,&rdquo; said Ellis, pressing his hand, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are in
a friend&rsquo;s hands that loved your father, and loves you for his
sake. Rest ye a little quietly, for ye are somewhat out of
case. Then shall ye tell me your story, and betwixt the two
of us we shall find a remedy for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later in the day, and after Dick had awakened
from a comfortable slumber to find himself still very weak,
but clearer in mind and easier in body, Ellis returned, and
sitting down by the bedside, begged him, in the name of his
father, to relate the circumstance of his escape from Tunstall
Moat House. There was something in the strength of
Duckworth&rsquo;s frame, in the honesty of his brown face, in the
clearness and shrewdness of his eyes, that moved Dick to
obey him; and from first to last the lad told him the story of
his two days&rsquo; adventures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ellis, when he had done, &ldquo;see what the
kind saints have done for you, Dick Shelton, not alone to
save your body in so numerous and deadly perils, but to
bring you into my hands, that have no dearer wish than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
assist your father&rsquo;s son. Be but true to me&mdash;and I see y&rsquo;
are true&mdash;and betwixt you and me we shall bring that false-heart
traitor to the death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye assault the house?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I were mad, indeed, to think of it,&rdquo; returned Ellis.
&ldquo;He hath too much power; his men gather to him; those
that gave me the slip last night, and by the mass came in so
handily for you&mdash;those have made him safe. Nay, Dick,
to the contrary, thou and I and my brave bowmen, we must
all slip from this forest speedily, and leave Sir Daniel
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind misgiveth me for Jack,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Jack!&rdquo; repeated Duckworth. &ldquo;O, I see, for
the wench! Nay, Dick! I promise you, if there come talk
of any marriage we shall act at once; till then, or till the
time is ripe, we shall all disappear, even like shadows at
morning; Sir Daniel shall look east and west, and see none
enemies; he shall think, by the mass, that he hath dreamed
a while, and hath now awakened in his bed. But our four
eyes, Dick, shall follow him right close, and our four hands&mdash;so
help us all the army of the saints!&mdash;shall bring that traitor
low!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pt2">Two days later Sir Daniel&rsquo;s garrison had grown to such
a strength that he ventured on a sally, and at the head of
some two score horsemen pushed without opposition as
far as Tunstall hamlet. Not an arrow flew, not a man
stirred in the thicket; the bridge was no longer guarded,
but stood open to all comers; and as Sir Daniel crossed
it, he saw the villagers looking timidly from their
doors.</p>

<p>Presently one of them, taking heart of grace, came
forward, and with the lowliest salutations, presented a letter
to the knight.</p>

<p>His face darkened as he read the contents. It ran
thus:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span></p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="noind center">&ldquo;<i>To the most untrue and cruel gentylman, Sir Daniel Brackley,
Knyght&mdash;These:</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I fynde ye were untrue and unkynd fro the first. Ye have
my father&rsquo;s blood upon your hands; let be, it will not wasshe.
Some day ye shall perish by my procurement, so much I let you to
wytte; and I let you to wytte farther, that if ye seek to wed to any
other the gentyl-woman, Mistresse Joan Sedley, whom that I am
bound upon a great oath to wed myself, the blow will be very swift.
The first step therinne will be thy first step to the grave.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>THE HOUSE BY THE SHORE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Months</span> had passed away since Richard Shelton made his
escape from the hands of his guardian. These months had
been eventful for England. The party of Lancaster, which
was then in the very article of death, had once more raised
its head. The Yorkists defeated and dispersed, their leader
butchered on the field, it seemed, for a very brief season in
the winter following upon the events already recorded, as
if the House of Lancaster had finally triumphed over its
foes.</p>

<p>The small town of Shoreby-on-the-Till was full of the
Lancastrian nobles of the neighbourhood. Earl Risingham
was there, with three hundred men-at-arms; Lord Shoreby,
with two hundred; Sir Daniel himself, high in favour, and
once more growing rich on confiscations, lay in a house of his
own, on the main street, with three score men. The world
had changed indeed.</p>

<p>It was a black, bitter cold evening in the first week of
January, with a hard frost, a high wind, and every likelihood
of snow before the morning.</p>

<p>In an obscure alehouse in a by-street near the harbour,
three or four men sat drinking ale and eating a hasty mess
of eggs. They were all likely, lusty, weather-beaten fellows,
hard of hand, bold of eye; and though they wore plain
tabards, like country ploughmen, even a drunken soldier
might have looked twice before he sought a quarrel in such
company.</p>

<p>A little apart before the huge fire sat a younger man,
almost a boy, dressed in much the same fashion, though it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
was easy to see by his looks that he was better born, and
might have worn a sword had the time suited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said one of the men at the table, &ldquo;I like it not.
Ill will come of it. This is no place for jolly fellows. A jolly
fellow loveth open country, good cover, and scarce foes; but
here we are shut in a town, girt about with enemies; and,
for the bull&rsquo;s-eye of misfortune, see if it snow not ere the
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for Master Shelton there,&rdquo; said another, nodding
his head towards the lad before the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do much for Master Shelton,&rdquo; returned the first;
&ldquo;but to come to the gallows for any man&mdash;nay, brothers,
not that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door of the inn opened, and another man entered
hastily and approached the youth before the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Sir Daniel goeth forth with
a pair of links and four archers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick (for this was our young friend) rose instantly to his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye will take John Capper&rsquo;s watch.&mdash;Greensheve,
follow with me.&mdash;Capper, lead forward. We
will follow him this time, an he go to York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment they were outside in the dark street,
and Capper, the man who had just come, pointed to where
two torches flared in the wind at a little distance.</p>

<p>The town was already sound asleep; no one moved upon
the streets, and there was nothing easier than to follow the
party without observation. The two link-bearers went
first; next followed a single man, whose long cloak blew
about him in the wind; and the rear was brought up by
the four archers, each with his bow upon his arm. They
moved at a brisk walk, threading the intricate lanes and
drawing nearer to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hath gone each night in this direction?&rdquo; asked
Dick, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the third night running, Master Shelton,&rdquo; returned
Capper, &ldquo;and still at the same hour and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
the same small following, as though his end were
secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Daniel and his six men were now come to the outskirts
of the country. Shoreby was an open town, and
though the Lancastrian lords who lay there kept a strong
guard on the main roads, it was still possible to enter or
depart unseen by any of the lesser streets or across the open
country.</p>

<p>The lane which Sir Daniel had been following came to an
abrupt end. Before him there was a stretch of rough down,
and the noise of the sea-surf was audible upon one hand.
There were no guards in the neighbourhood, nor any light
in that quarter of the town.</p>

<p>Dick and his two outlaws drew a little closer to the object
of their chase, and presently, as they came forth from between
the houses, and could see a little farther upon either
hand, they were aware of another torch drawing near from
another direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I smell treason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Daniel had come to a full halt. The
torches were stuck into the sand, and the men lay down, as
if to await the arrival of the other party.</p>

<p>This drew near at a good rate. It consisted of four men
only&mdash;a pair of archers, a varlet with a link, and a cloaked
gentleman walking in their midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, my lord?&rdquo; cried Sir Daniel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, indeed; and if ever true knight gave proof I am
that man,&rdquo; replied the leader of the second troop; &ldquo;for
who would rather not face giants, sorcerers, or pagans, than
this pinching cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; returned Sir Daniel, &ldquo;beauty will be the
more beholden, misdoubt it not. But shall we forth? for
the sooner ye have seen my merchandise, the sooner shall
we both get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why keep ye her here, good knight?&rdquo; inquired
the other. &ldquo;An she be so young, and so fair, and so wealthy,
why do ye not bring her forth among her mates? Ye would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
soon make her a good marriage, and no need to freeze your
fingers and risk arrow-shots by going abroad at such untimely
seasons in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you, my lord,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel, &ldquo;the
reason thereof concerneth me only. Neither do I purpose
to explain it further. Suffice it, that if ye be weary of your
old gossip, Daniel Brackley, publish it abroad that y&rsquo; are to
wed Joanna Sedley, and I give you my word ye will be quit
of him right soon. Ye will find him with an arrow in his
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime the two gentlemen were walking briskly
forward over the down; the three torches going before them,
stooping against the wind and scattering clouds of smoke
and tufts of flame, and the rear brought up by the six
archers.</p>

<p>Close upon the heels of these Dick followed. He had,
of course, heard no word of this conversation; but he had
recognised in the second of the speakers old Lord Shoreby
himself, a man of an infamous reputation, whom even Sir
Daniel affected, in public, to condemn.</p>

<p>Presently they came close down upon the beach. The
air smelt salt; the noise of the surf increased; and here, in a
large walled garden, there stood a small house of two stories,
with stables and other offices.</p>

<p>The foremost torch-bearer unlocked a door in the wall,
and, after the whole party had passed into the garden, again
closed and locked it on the other side.</p>

<p>Dick and his men were thus excluded from any further
following, unless they should scale the wall and thus put
their necks in a trap.</p>

<p>They sat down in a tuft of furze and waited. The red
glow of the torches moved up and down and to and fro
within the enclosure, as if the link-bearers steadily patrolled
the garden.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed, and then the whole party issued
forth again upon the down; and Sir Daniel and the baron,
after an elaborate salutation, separated and turned severally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
homeward, each with his own following of men and
lights.</p>

<p>As soon as the sound of their steps had been swallowed
by the wind, Dick got to his feet as briskly as he was able,
for he was stiff and aching with the cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capper, ye will give me a back up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>They advanced, all three, to the wall; Capper stooped,
and Dick, getting upon his shoulders, clambered on to the
copestone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Greensheve,&rdquo; whispered Dick, &ldquo;follow me up
here; lie flat upon your face, that ye may be the less seen;
and be ever ready to give me a hand if I fall foully on the
other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, he dropped into the garden.</p>

<p>It was all pitch dark; there was no light in the house.
The wind whistled shrill among the poor shrubs, and the
surf beat upon the beach; there was no other sound.
Cautiously Dick footed it forth, stumbling among bushes,
and groping with his hands; and presently the crisp noise
of gravel underfoot told him that he had struck upon an
alley.</p>

<p>Here he paused, and taking his crossbow from where he
kept it concealed under his long tabard, he prepared it for
instant action, and went forward once more with greater
resolution and assurance. The path led him straight to
the group of buildings.</p>

<p>All seemed to be sorely dilapidated: the windows of the
house were secured by crazy shutters; the stables were open
and empty; there was no hay in the hayloft, no corn in the
corn-box. Any one would have supposed the place to be
deserted; but Dick had good reason to think otherwise.
He continued his inspection, visiting the offices, trying all
the windows. At length he came round to the sea-side of
the house, and there, sure enough, there burned a pale light
in one of the upper windows.</p>

<p>He stepped back a little way, till he thought he could see
the movement of a shadow on the wall of the apartment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
Then he remembered that in the stable his groping hand
had rested for a moment on a ladder, and he returned with all
despatch to bring it. The ladder was very short, but yet, by
standing on the topmost round, he could bring his hands as
high as the iron bars of the window; and, seizing these, he
raised his body by main force until his eyes commanded the
interior of the room.</p>

<p>Two persons were within: the first he readily knew to
be Dame Hatch; the second, a tall and beautiful and grave
young lady, in a long, embroidered dress&mdash;could that be
Joanna Sedley? his old wood companion, Jack, whom he
had thought to punish with a belt?</p>

<p>He dropped back again to the top round of the ladder
in a kind of amazement. He had never thought of his
sweetheart as of so superior a being, and he was instantly
taken with a feeling of diffidence. But he had little opportunity
for thought. A low &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; sounded from close by,
and he hastened to descend the ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greensheve,&rdquo; came the reply, in tones similarly guarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What want ye?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is watched, Master Shelton,&rdquo; returned the
outlaw. &ldquo;We are not alone to watch it; for even as I lay
on my belly on the wall I saw men prowling in the dark, and
heard them whistle softly one to the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my sooth,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;but this is passing strange!
Were they not men of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, that they were not,&rdquo; returned Greensheve;
&ldquo;for if I have eyes in my head, every man-Jack of them
weareth me a white badge in his bonnet, something chequered
with dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;White, chequered with dark?&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;Faith,
&rsquo;tis a badge I know not. It is none of this country&rsquo;s badges.&mdash;Well,
an that be so, let us slip as quietly forth from this
garden as we may; for here we are in an evil posture for
defence. Beyond all question there are men of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s
in that house, and to be taken between two shots is a beggarman&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
position. Take me this ladder; I must leave it where
I found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They returned the ladder to the stable, and groped their
way to the place where they had entered.</p>

<p>Capper had taken Greensheve&rsquo;s position on the cope, and
now he leaned down his hand, and, first one and then the
other, pulled them up.</p>

<p>Cautiously and silently they dropped again upon the
other side; nor did they dare to speak until they had returned
to their old ambush in the gorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, John Capper,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;back with you to
Shoreby, even as for your life. Bring me instantly what
men ye can collect. Here shall be the rendezvous; or if the
men be scattered and the day be near at hand before they
muster, let the place be something farther back, and by the
entering in of the town. Greensheve and I lie here to watch.
Speed ye, John Capper, and the saints aid you to despatch!&mdash;And
now, Greensheve,&rdquo; he continued, as soon as Capper had
departed, &ldquo;let thou and I go round about the garden in a
wide circuit. I would fain see whether thine eyes betrayed
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keeping well outwards from the wall, and profiting by
every height and hollow, they passed about two sides,
beholding nothing. On the third side the garden wall
was built close upon the beach, and to preserve the distance
necessary to their purpose, they had to go some way down
upon the sands. Although the tide was still pretty far out,
the surf was so high, and the sands so flat, that at each
breaker a great sheet of froth and water came careering over
the expanse, and Dick and Greensheve made this part of
their inspection wading, now to the ankles, and now as deep
as to the knees, in the salt and icy waters of the German
Ocean.</p>

<p>Suddenly, against the comparative whiteness of the
garden wall, the figure of a man was seen, like a faint Chinese
shadow, violently signalling with both arms. As he dropped
again to the earth, another arose a little farther on and repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
the same performance. And so, like a silent watch-word,
these gesticulations made the round of the beleaguered
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They keep good watch,&rdquo; Dick whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us back to land, good master,&rdquo; answered Greensheve.
&ldquo;We stand here too open; for, look ye, when the
seas break heavy and white out there behind us, they shall
see us plainly against the foam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak sooth,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Ashore with us,
right speedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>A SKIRMISH IN THE DARK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Thoroughly</span> drenched and chilled, the two adventurers
returned to their position in the gorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray Heaven that Capper make good speed!&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;I vow a candle to St. Mary of Shoreby if he come
before the hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are in a hurry, Master Dick?&rdquo; asked Greensheve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, good fellow,&rdquo; answered Dick; &ldquo;for in that house
lieth my lady, whom I love, and who should these be that
lie about her secretly by night? Unfriends for sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Greensheve, &ldquo;an John come speedily,
we shall give a good account of them. They are not two
score at the outside&mdash;I judge so by the spacing of their
sentries&mdash;and, taken where they are, lying so widely, one
score would scatter them like sparrows. And yet, Master
Dick, an she be in Sir Daniel&rsquo;s power already, it will little
hurt that she should change into another&rsquo;s. Who should
these be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do suspect the Lord of Shoreby,&rdquo; Dick replied.
&ldquo;When came they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They began to come, Master Dick,&rdquo; said Greensheve,
&ldquo;about the time ye crossed the wall. I had not lain there
the space of a minute ere I marked the first of the knaves
crawling round the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last light had been already extinguished in the little
house when they were wading in the wash of the breakers,
and it was impossible to predict at what moment the lurking
men about the garden wall might make their onslaught.
Of two evils, Dick preferred the least. He preferred that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
Joanna should remain under the guardianship of Sir Daniel
rather than pass into the clutches of Lord Shoreby; and his
mind was made up, if the house should be assaulted, to come
at once to the relief of the besieged.</p>

<p>But the time passed, and still there was no movement.
From quarter of an hour to quarter of an hour the same
signal passed about the garden wall, as if the leader desired
to assure himself of the vigilance of his scattered followers;
but in every other particular the neighbourhood of the little
house lay undisturbed.</p>

<p>Presently Dick&rsquo;s reinforcements began to arrive. The
night was not yet old before nearly a score of men crouched
beside him in the gorse.</p>

<p>Separating these into two bodies, he took the command
of the smaller himself, and entrusted the larger to the leadership
of Greensheve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Kit,&rdquo; said he to this last, &ldquo;take me your men to
the near angle of the garden wall upon the beach. Post
them strongly, and wait till that ye hear me falling on upon
the other side. It is those upon the sea front that I would
fain make certain of, for there will be the leader. The rest
will run; even let them. And now, lads, let no man draw
an arrow; ye will but hurt friends. Take to the steel, and
keep to the steel; and if we have the uppermost, I promise
every man of you a gold noble when I come to mine
estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of the odd collection of broken men, thieves,
murderers, and ruined peasantry, whom Duckworth had
gathered together to serve the purposes of his revenge, some
of the boldest and the most experienced in war had volunteered
to follow Richard Shelton. The service of watching
Sir Daniel&rsquo;s movements in the town of Shoreby had from the
first been irksome to their temper, and they had of late
begun to grumble loudly and threaten to disperse. The
prospect of a sharp encounter and possible spoils restored
them to good humour, and they joyfully prepared for battle.</p>

<p>Their long tabards thrown aside, they appeared, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
in plain green jerkins, and some in stout leathern jacks;
under their hoods many wore bonnets strengthened by iron
plates; and for offensive armour, swords, daggers, a few
stout boar-spears, and a dozen of bright bills, put them in a
posture to engage even regular feudal troops. The bows,
quivers, and tabards were concealed among the gorse, and
the two bands set resolutely forward.</p>

<p>Dick, when he had reached the other side of the house,
posted his six men in a line, about twenty yards from the
garden wall, and took position himself a few paces in front.
Then they all shouted with one voice, and closed upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>These, lying widely scattered, stiff with cold, and taken
at unawares, sprang stupidly to their feet, and stood undecided.
Before they had time to get their courage about
them, or even to form an idea of the number and mettle of
their assailants, a similar shout of onslaught sounded in
their ears from the far side of the enclosure. Thereupon
they gave themselves up for lost, and ran.</p>

<p>In this way the two small troops of the men of the Black
Arrow closed upon the sea front of the garden wall, and took
a part of the strangers, as it were, between two fires; while
the whole of the remainder ran for their lives in different
directions, and were soon scattered in the darkness.</p>

<p>For all that, the fight was but beginning. Dick&rsquo;s outlaws,
although they had the advantage of the surprise, were
still considerably outnumbered by the men they had surrounded.
The tide had flowed in the meanwhile; the beach
was narrowed to a strip; and on this wet field between the
surf and the garden wall, there began, in the darkness, a
doubtful, furious, and deadly contest.</p>

<p>The strangers were well armed; they fell in silence upon
their assailants; and the affray became a series of single
combats. Dick, who had come first into the mellay, was
engaged by three; the first he cut down at the first blow,
but the other two coming upon him hotly he was fain to
give ground before their onset. One of these two was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
huge fellow, almost a giant for stature, and armed with a
two-handed sword, which he brandished like a switch.
Against this opponent, with his reach of arm and the length
and weight of his weapon, Dick and his bill were quite defenceless;
and had the other continued to join vigorously
in the attack, the lad must have indubitably fallen. This
second man, however, less in stature and slower in his movements,
paused for a moment to peer about him in the darkness,
and to give ear to the sounds of the battle.</p>

<p>The giant still pursued his advantage, and still Dick
fled before him, spying for his chance. Then the huge
blade flashed and descended, and the lad, leaping on one
side and running in, slashed sideways and upwards with
his bill. A roar of agony responded, and before the wounded
man could raise his formidable weapon, Dick, twice repeating
his blow, had brought him to the ground.</p>

<p>The next moment he was engaged upon more equal terms
with his second pursuer. Here there was no great difference
in size, and though the man, fighting with sword and dagger
against a bill, and being wary and quick of fence, had a certain
superiority of arms, Dick more than made it up by his
greater agility on foot. Neither at first gained any obvious
advantage; but the older man was still insensibly profiting
by the ardour of the younger to lead him where he would;
and presently Dick found that they had crossed the whole
width of the beach, and were now fighting above the knees
in the spume and bubble of the breakers. Here his own
superior activity was rendered useless; he found himself
more or less at the discretion of his foe; yet a little, and he
had his back turned upon his own men, and saw that this
adroit and skilful adversary was bent upon drawing him
farther and farther away.</p>

<p>Dick ground his teeth. He determined to decide the
combat instantly; and when the wash of the next wave had
ebbed and left them dry, he rushed in, caught a blow upon
his bill, and leaped right at the throat of his opponent. The
man went down backwards, with Dick still upon the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
him; and the next wave, speedily succeeding the last,
buried him below a rush of water.</p>

<p>While he was still submerged, Dick forced his dagger
from his grasp, and rose to his feet victorious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yield ye!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I give you life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I yield me,&rdquo; said the other, getting to his knees. &ldquo;Ye
fight, like a young man, ignorantly and foolhardily; but,
by the array of the saints, ye fight bravely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick turned to the beach. The combat was still raging
doubtfully in the night; over the hoarse roar of the breakers
steel clanged upon steel, and cries of pain and the shout of
battle resounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead me to your captain, youth,&rdquo; said the conquered
knight. &ldquo;It is fit this butchery should cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;so far as these brave fellows have
a captain, the poor gentleman who here addresses you is
he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call off your dogs, then, and I will bid my villains
hold,&rdquo; returned the other.</p>

<p>There was something noble both in the voice and manner
of his late opponent, and Dick instantly dismissed all fears
of treachery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay down your arms, men!&rdquo; cried the stranger knight.
&ldquo;I have yielded me, upon promise of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone of the stranger was one of absolute command,
and almost instantly the din and confusion of the mellay
ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;are ye safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried Lawless, &ldquo;safe and hearty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light me the lantern,&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not Sir Daniel here?&rdquo; inquired the knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel?&rdquo; echoed Dick. &ldquo;Now, by the rood, I
pray not. It would go ill with me if he were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill with <i>you</i>, fair sir?&rdquo; inquired the other. &ldquo;Nay,
then, if ye be not of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s party, I profess I comprehend
no longer. Wherefore, then, fell ye upon mine ambush?
in what quarrel, my young and very fiery friend? to what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
earthly purpose? and to make a clear end of questioning,
to what good gentleman have I surrendered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before Dick could answer, a voice spoke in the darkness
from close by. Dick could see the speaker&rsquo;s black and
white badge, and the respectful salute which he addressed
to his superior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if these gentlemen be unfriends
to Sir Daniel, it is a pity, indeed, we should have been at
blows with them; but it were tenfold greater that either
they or we should linger here. The watchers in the house&mdash;unless
they be all dead or deaf&mdash;have heard our hammering
this quarter-hour agone; instantly they will have signalled
to the town; and unless we be the livelier in our departure,
we are like to be taken, both of us, by a fresh foe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawksley is in the right,&rdquo; added the lord. &ldquo;How
please ye, sir? Whither shall we march?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;go where you will for me.
I do begin to suspect we have some ground of friendship,
and if, indeed, I began our acquaintance somewhat ruggedly,
I would not churlishly continue. Let us then, separate,
my lord, you laying your right hand in mine; and at the
hour and place that ye shall name, let us encounter and
agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are too trustful, boy,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;but this
time your trust is not misplaced. I will meet you at the
point of day at St. Bride&rsquo;s Cross.&mdash;Come, lads, follow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strangers disappeared from the scene with a rapidity
that seemed suspicious; and, while the outlaws fell to the
congenial task of rifling the dead bodies, Dick made once
more the circuit of the garden wall to examine the front of
the house. In a little upper loophole of the roof he beheld
a light set; and as it would certainly be visible in town from
the back windows of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s mansion, he doubted not
that this was the signal feared by Hawksley, and that ere
long the lances of the Knight of Tunstall would arrive upon
the scene.</p>

<p>He put his ear to the ground, and it seemed to him as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
he heard a jarring and hollow noise from townward. Back
to the beach he went hurrying. But the work was already
done; the last body was disarmed and stripped to the skin,
and four fellows were already wading seaward to commit it
to the mercies of the deep.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when there debouched out of the
nearest lanes of Shoreby some two score horsemen, hastily
arrayed and moving at the gallop of their steeds, the neighbourhood
of the house beside the sea was entirely silent and
deserted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick and his men had returned to the alehouse
of the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes&rdquo; to snatch some hours of
sleep before the morning tryst.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>ST. BRIDE&rsquo;S CROSS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">St. Bride&rsquo;s Cross</span> stood a little way back from Shoreby,
on the skirts of Tunstall Forest. Two roads met: one,
from Holywood across the forest; one, that road from
Risingham down which we saw the wrecks of a Lancastrian
army fleeing in disorder. Here the two joined issue, and
went on together down the hill to Shoreby; and a little
back from the point of junction, the summit of a little
knoll was crowned by the ancient and weather-beaten
cross.</p>

<p>Here, then, about seven in the morning, Dick arrived.
It was as cold as ever; the earth was all grey and silver with
the hoar-frost, and the day began to break in the east with
many colours of purple and orange.</p>

<p>Dick set him down upon the lowest step of the cross,
wrapped himself well in his tabard, and looked vigilantly
upon all sides. He had not long to wait. Down the road
from Holywood a gentleman in very rich and bright armour,
and wearing over that a surcoat of the rarest furs, came
pacing on a splendid charger. Twenty yards behind him
followed a clump of lancers; but these halted as soon as they
came in view of the trysting-place, while the gentleman in
the fur surcoat continued to advance alone.</p>

<p>His visor was raised, and showed a countenance of great
command and dignity, answerable to the richness of his
attire and arms. And it was with some confusion of manner
that Dick arose from the cross and stepped down the bank
to meet his prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, my lord, for your exactitude,&rdquo; he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
louting very low. &ldquo;Will it please your lordship to set foot
to earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye here alone, young man?&rdquo; inquired the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not so simple,&rdquo; answered Dick; &ldquo;and, to be
plain with your lordship, the woods upon either hand of this
cross lie full of mine honest fellows lying on their weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; have done wisely,&rdquo; said the lord. &ldquo;It pleaseth me
the rather, since last night ye fought foolhardily, and more
like a salvage Saracen lunatic than any Christian warrior.
But it becomes not me to complain, that had the undermost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye had the undermost indeed, my lord, since ye so
fell,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;but had the waves not holpen me,
it was I that should have had the worst. Ye were pleased
to make me yours with several dagger-marks, which I still
carry. And in fine, my lord, methinks I had all the danger,
as well as all the profit, of that little blind-man&rsquo;s medley on
the beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are shrewd enough to make light of it, I see,&rdquo; returned
the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord, not shrewd,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;in that I
shoot at no advantage to myself. But when, by the light
of this new day, I see how stout a knight hath yielded, not
to my arms alone, but to fortune, and the darkness, and the
surf&mdash;and how easily the battle had gone otherwise, with a
soldier so untried and rustic as myself&mdash;think it not strange,
my lord, if I feel confounded with my victory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak well,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name, an&rsquo;t like you, is Shelton,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men call me the Lord Foxham,&rdquo; added the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my lord, and under your good favour, ye are
guardian to the sweetest maid in England,&rdquo; replied Dick;
&ldquo;and for your ransom, and the ransom of such as were taken
with you on the beach, there will be no uncertainty of terms.
I pray you, my lord, of your good-will and charity, yield me
the hand of my mistress, Joan Sedley; and take ye, upon
the other part, your liberty, the liberty of these your followers,
and (if ye will have it) my gratitude and service till I die.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But are ye not ward to Sir Daniel? Methought, if
y&rsquo; are Harry Shelton&rsquo;s son, that I had heard it so reported,&rdquo;
said Lord Foxham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it please you, my lord, to alight? I would fain
tell you fully who I am, how situate, and why so bold in my
demands. Beseech you, my lord, take place upon these
steps, hear me to a full end, and judge me with allowance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, Dick lent a hand to Lord Foxham to
dismount; led him up the knoll to the cross; installed him
in the place where he had himself been sitting; and standing
respectfully before his noble prisoner, related the story of
his fortunes up to the events of the evening before.</p>

<p>Lord Foxham listened gravely, and when Dick had done,
&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye are a most fortunate-unfortunate
young gentleman; but what fortune y&rsquo; have had,
that ye have amply merited; and what unfortune, ye have
noways deserved. Be of a good cheer; for ye have made
a friend who is devoid neither of power nor favour. For
yourself, although it fits not for a person of your birth to
herd with outlaws, I must own ye are both brave and honourable;
very dangerous in battle, right courteous in peace, a
youth of excellent disposition and brave bearing. For your
estates, ye will never see them till the world shall change
again; so long as Lancaster hath the strong hand, so long
shall Sir Daniel enjoy them for his own. For my ward, it
is another matter; I had promised her before to a gentleman,
a kinsman of my house, one Hamley; the promise is
old&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, my lord, and now Sir Daniel hath promised
her to my Lord Shoreby,&rdquo; interrupted Dick. &ldquo;And his
promise, for all it is but young, is still the likelier to be
made good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tis the plain truth,&rdquo; returned his lordship. &ldquo;And
considering, moreover, that I am your prisoner, upon no
better composition than my bare life, and over and above
that, that the maiden is unhappily in other hands, I will so
far consent. Aid me with your good fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;they are these same outlaws
that ye blame me for consorting with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them be what they will, they can fight,&rdquo; returned
Lord Foxham. &ldquo;Help me, then; and if between us we
regain the maid, upon my knightly honour, she shall marry
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick bent his knee before his prisoner; but he, leaping up
lightly from the cross, caught the lad up and embraced him
like a son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an y&rsquo; are to marry Joan, we must be
early friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE &ldquo;GOOD HOPE&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">An</span> hour thereafter, Dick was back at the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes,&rdquo;
breaking his fast, and receiving the report of his
messengers and sentries. Duckworth was still absent from
Shoreby; and this was frequently the case, for he played
many parts in the world, shared many different interests,
and conducted many various affairs. He had founded that
fellowship of the Black Arrow, as a ruined man longing for
vengeance and money; and yet among those who knew
him best, he was thought to be the agent and emissary
of the great King-maker of England, Richard, Earl of
Warwick.</p>

<p>In his absence, at any rate, it fell upon Richard Shelton
to command affairs in Shoreby; and as he sat at meat his
mind was full of care, and his face heavy with consideration.
It had been determined, between him and the Lord Foxham,
to make one bold stroke that evening, and, by brute force,
to set Joanna free. The obstacles, however, were many;
and as one after another of his scouts arrived, each brought
him more discomfortable news.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel was alarmed by the skirmish of the night before.
He had increased the garrison of the house in the
garden; but, not content with that, he had stationed horsemen
in all the neighbouring lanes, so that he might
have instant word of any movement. Meanwhile, in
the court of his mansion, steeds stood saddled, and the
riders, armed at every point, awaited but the signal to
ride.</p>

<p>The adventure of the night appeared more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
difficult of execution, till suddenly Dick&rsquo;s countenance
lightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you that were a shipman, can
ye steal me a ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Dick,&rdquo; replied Lawless, &ldquo;if ye would back me,
I would agree to steal York Minster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently after, these two set forth and descended to
the harbour. It was a considerable basin, lying among
sandhills, and surrounded with patches of down, ancient
ruinous lumber, and tumble-down slums of the town.
Many decked ships and many open boats either lay there at
anchor, or had been drawn up on the beach. A long duration
of bad weather had driven them from the high seas into
the shelter of the port; and the great trooping of black
clouds, and the cold squalls that followed one another, now
with a sprinkling of dry snow, now in a mere swoop of wind,
promised no improvement, but rather threatened a more
serious storm in the immediate future.</p>

<p>The seamen, in view of the cold and the wind, had for
the most part slunk ashore, and were now roaring and singing
in the shoreside taverns. Many of the ships already
rode unguarded at their anchors; and as the day wore on,
and the weather offered no appearance of improvement, the
number was continually being augmented. It was to these
deserted ships, and, above all, to those of them that lay far
out, that Lawless directed his attention; while Dick, seated
upon an anchor that was half embedded in the sand, and
giving ear, now to the rude, potent, and boding voices of
the gale, and now to the hoarse singing of the shipmen in a
neighbouring tavern, soon forgot his immediate surroundings
and concerns in the agreeable recollection of Lord Foxham&rsquo;s
promise.</p>

<p>He was disturbed by a touch upon his shoulder. It
was Lawless, pointing to a small ship that lay somewhat by
itself, and within but a little of the harbour mouth, where it
heaved regularly and smoothly on the entering swell. A
pale gleam of winter sunshine fell, at that moment, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
vessel&rsquo;s deck, relieving her against a bank of scowling cloud;
and in this momentary glitter Dick could see a couple of
men hauling the skiff alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; said Lawless, &ldquo;mark ye it well! There is
the ship for to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently the skiff put out from the vessel&rsquo;s side, and the
two men, keeping her head well to the wind, pulled lustily
for shore. Lawless turned to a loiterer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How call ye her?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the little
vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call her the <i>Good Hope</i>, of Dartmouth,&rdquo; replied
the loiterer. &ldquo;Her captain, Arblaster by name. He
pulleth the bow oar in yon skiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was all that Lawless wanted. Hurriedly thanking
the man, he moved round the shore to a certain sandy creek,
for which the skiff was heading. There he took up his
position, and as soon as they were within earshot, opened fire
on the sailors of the <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Gossip Arblaster!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, ye
be well met; nay, gossip, ye be right well met, upon the
rood! And is that the <i>Good Hope</i>? Ay, I would know her
among ten thousand!&mdash;a sweet shear, a sweet boat! But
marry, come up, my gossip, will ye drink? I have come
into mine estate, which doubtless ye remember to have
heard on. I am now rich; I have left to sail upon the sea;
I do sail now, for the most part, upon spiced ale. Come,
fellow; thy hand upon &rsquo;t! Come, drink with an old ship-fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skipper Arblaster, a long-faced, elderly, weather-beaten
man, with a knife hanging about his neck by a plaited cord,
and for all the world like any modern seaman in his gait and
bearing, had hung back in obvious amazement and distrust.
But the name of an estate, and a certain air of tipsified
simplicity and good-fellowship which Lawless very well
affected, combined to conquer his suspicious jealousy; his
countenance relaxed, and he at once extended his open hand
and squeezed that of the outlaw in a formidable grasp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot mind you. But what o&rsquo;
that? I would drink with any man, gossip, and so would
my man Tom.&mdash;Man Tom,&rdquo; he added, addressing his follower,
&ldquo;here is my gossip, whose name I cannot mind, but no
doubt a very good seaman. Let&rsquo;s go drink with him and
his shore friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawless led the way, and they were soon seated in an
alehouse, which, as it was very new, and stood in an exposed
and solitary station, was less crowded than those nearer to
the centre of the port. It was but a shed of timber, much
like a block-house in the backwoods of to-day, and was
coarsely furnished with a press or two, a number of naked
benches, and boards set upon barrels to play the part of
tables. In the middle, and besieged by half a hundred
violent draughts, a fire of wreck-wood blazed and vomited
thick smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, now,&rdquo; said Lawless, &ldquo;here is a shipman&rsquo;s joy&mdash;a
good fire and a good stiff cup ashore, with foul weather
without and an off-sea gale a-snoring in the roof! Here&rsquo;s
to the <i>Good Hope</i>! May she ride easy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Skipper Arblaster, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis good weather to
be ashore in, that is sooth&mdash;Man Tom, how say ye to that?&mdash;Gossip,
ye speak well, though I can never think upon your
name; but ye speak very well. May the <i>Good Hope</i> ride
easy! Amen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend Dickon,&rdquo; resumed Lawless, addressing his
commander, &ldquo;ye have certain matters on hand, unless I
err? Well, prithee be about them incontinently. For here
I be with the choice of all good company, two tough old
shipmen; and till that ye return I will go warrant these
brave fellows will bide here and drink me cup for cup. We
are not like shore-men, we old tough tarry-Johns!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well meant,&rdquo; returned the skipper. &ldquo;Ye can go,
boy; for I will keep your good friend and my good gossip
company till curfew&mdash;ay, and by St. Mary, till the sun get
up again! For, look ye, when a man hath been long
enough at sea, the salt getteth me into the clay upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
bones; and let him drink a draw-well, he will never be
quenched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged upon all hands, Dick rose, saluted his
company, and going forth again into the gusty afternoon,
got him as speedily as he might to the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes.&rdquo;
Thence he sent word to my Lord Foxham that, so soon as
ever the evening closed, they would have a stout boat to
keep the sea in. And then leading along with him a couple
of outlaws who had some experience of the sea, he returned
himself to the harbour and the little sandy creek.</p>

<p>The skiff of the <i>Good Hope</i> lay among many others, from
which it was easily distinguished by its extreme smallness
and fragility. Indeed, when Dick and his two men had taken
their places, and began to put forth out of the creek into the
open harbour, the little cockle dipped into the swell and
staggered under every gust of wind, like a thing upon the
point of sinking.</p>

<p>The <i>Good Hope</i>, as we have said, was anchored far out,
where the swell was heaviest. No other vessel lay nearer
than several cables&rsquo; length; those that were the nearest
were themselves entirely deserted; and as the skiff approached,
a thick flurry of snow and a sudden darkening of
the weather further concealed the movements of the outlaws
from all possible espial. In a trice they had leaped upon the
heaving deck, and the skiff was dancing at the stern. The
<i>Good Hope</i> was captured.</p>

<p>She was a good stout boat, decked in the bows and
amidships, but open in the stern. She carried one mast,
and was rigged between a felucca and a lugger. It would
seem that Skipper Arblaster had made an excellent venture,
for the hold was full of pieces of French wine; and in the
little cabin, besides the Virgin Mary in the bulkhead which
proved the captain&rsquo;s piety, there were many lockfast chests
and cupboards, which showed him to be rich and careful.</p>

<p>A dog, who was the sole occupant of the vessel, furiously
barked, and bit the heels of the boarders, but he was soon
kicked into the cabin, and the door shut upon his just resentment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
A lamp was lit and fixed in the shrouds to mark
the vessel clearly from the shore; one of the wine pieces in
the hold was broached, and a cup of excellent Gascony
emptied to the adventure of the evening; and then, while
one of the outlaws began to get ready his bow and arrows
and prepare to hold the ship against all comers, the other
hauled in the skiff and got overboard, where he held on,
waiting for Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, keep me a good watch,&rdquo; said the young
commander, preparing to follow his subordinate. &ldquo;Ye
will do right well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Jack, &ldquo;I shall do excellent well
indeed, so long as we lie here; but once we put the nose of
this poor ship outside the harbour&mdash;&mdash;. See, there she
trembles! Nay, the poor shrew heard the words, and the
heart misgave her in her oak-tree ribs. But look, Master
Dick! how black the weather gathers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The darkness ahead was, indeed, astonishing. Great
billows heaved up out of the blackness, one after another;
and one after another the <i>Good Hope</i> buoyantly climbed,
and giddily plunged upon the farther side. A thin sprinkle
of snow and thin flakes of foam came flying, and powdered
the deck; and the wind harped dismally among the
rigging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In sooth, it looketh evilly,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;But what
cheer! &rsquo;Tis but a squall, and presently it will blow over.&rdquo;
But, in spite of his words, he was depressingly affected by
the bleak disorder of the sky and the wailing and fluting of
the wind; and as he got over the side of the <i>Good Hope</i> and
made once more for the landing-creek with the best speed of
oars, he crossed himself devoutly, and recommended to
Heaven the lives of all who should adventure on the sea.</p>

<p>At the landing-creek there had already gathered about
a dozen of the outlaws. To these the skiff was left, and they
were bidden embark without delay.</p>

<p>A little farther up the beach Dick found Lord Foxham
hurrying in quest of him, his face concealed with a dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
hood, and his bright armour covered by a long russet mantle
of a poor appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Shelton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are ye for sea, then, truly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied Richard, &ldquo;they lie about the house
with horsemen; it may not be reached from the land side
without alarum; and Sir Daniel once advertised of our
adventure, we can no more carry it to a good end than,
saving your presence, we could ride upon the wind. Now,
in going round by sea, we do run some peril by the elements;
but, what much outweigheth all, we have a chance to make
good our purpose and bear off the maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Lord Foxham, &ldquo;lead on. I will, in
some sort, follow you for shame&rsquo;s sake; but I own I would I
were in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, then,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Hither we go to fetch our
pilot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he led the way to the rude alehouse where he had
given rendezvous to a portion of his men. Some of these
he found lingering round the door outside; others had pushed
more boldly in, and, choosing places as near as possible to
where they saw their comrade, gathered close about Lawless
and the two shipmen. These, to judge by the distempered
countenance and cloudy eye, had long since gone beyond
the boundaries of moderation; and as Richard entered,
closely followed by Lord Foxham, they were all three tuning
up an old, pitiful sea-ditty, to the chorus of the wailing of
the gale.</p>

<p>The young leader cast a rapid glance about the shed.
The fire had just been replenished, and gave forth volumes
of black smoke, so that it was difficult to see clearly in the
farther corners. It was plain, however, that the outlaws
very largely outnumbered the remainder of the guests.
Satisfied upon this point, in case of any failure in the operation
of his plan, Dick strode up to the table and resumed his
place upon the bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; cried the skipper tipsily, &ldquo;who are ye, hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a word with you without, Master Arblaster,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
returned Dick; &ldquo;and here is what we shall talk of.&rdquo; And he
showed him a gold noble in the glimmer of the firelight.</p>

<p>The shipman&rsquo;s eyes burned, although he still failed to
recognise our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am with you.&mdash;Gossip, I will be
back anon. Drink fair, gossip&rdquo;; and, taking Dick&rsquo;s arm
to steady his uneven steps, he walked to the door of the alehouse.</p>

<p>As soon as he was over the threshold, ten strong arms had
seized and bound him; and in two minutes more, with his
limbs trussed one to another, and a good gag in his mouth,
he had been tumbled neck and crop into a neighbouring
hay-barn. Presently, his man Tom, similarly secured, was
tossed beside him, and the pair were left to their uncouth
reflections for the night.</p>

<p>And now, as the time for concealment had gone by, Lord
Foxham&rsquo;s followers were summoned by a preconcerted signal,
and the party, boldly taking possession of as many boats as
their numbers required, pulled in a flotilla for the light in
the rigging of the ship. Long before the last man had climbed
to the deck of the <i>Good Hope</i>, the sound of furious shouting
from the shore showed that a part, at least, of the seamen
had discovered the loss of their skiffs.</p>

<p>But it was now too late, whether for recovery or revenge.
Out of some forty fighting men now mustered in the stolen
ship, eight had been to sea, and could play the part of
mariners. With the aid of these, a slice of sail was got upon
her. The cable was cut. Lawless, vacillating on his feet,
and still shouting the chorus of sea-ballads, took the long
tiller in his hands: and the <i>Good Hope</i> began to flit forward
into the darkness of the night, and to face the great waves
beyond the harbour bar.</p>

<p>Richard took his place beside the weather rigging. Except
for the ship&rsquo;s own lantern, and for some lights in Shoreby
town, that were already fading to leeward, the whole world
of air was as black as in a pit. Only from time to time, as
the <i>Good Hope</i> swooped dizzily down into the valley of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
rollers, a crest would break&mdash;a great cataract of snowy foam
would leap in one instant into being&mdash;and, in an instant
more, would stream into the wake and vanish.</p>

<p>Many of the men lay holding on and praying aloud;
many more were sick, and had crept into the bottom, where
they sprawled among the cargo. And what with the extreme
violence of the motion, and the continued drunken
bravado of Lawless, still shouting and singing at the helm,
the stoutest heart on board may have nourished a shrewd
misgiving as to the result.</p>

<p>But Lawless, as if guided by an instinct, steered the ship
across the breakers, struck the lee of a great sandbank,
where they sailed for a while in smooth water, and presently
after laid her alongside a rude stone pier, where she was
hastily made fast, and lay ducking and grinding in the dark.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>THE &ldquo;GOOD HOPE&rdquo; (<i>continued</i>)</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> pier was not far distant from the house in which Joanna
lay; it now only remained to get the men on shore, to surround
the house with a strong party, burst in the door and
carry off the captive. They might then regard themselves
as done with the <i>Good Hope</i>; it had placed them on the
rear of their enemies; and the retreat, whether they should
succeed or fail in the main enterprise, would be directed
with a greater measure of hope in the direction of the forest
and my Lord Foxham&rsquo;s reserve.</p>

<p>To get the men on shore, however, was no easy task;
many had been sick, all were pierced with cold; the promiscuity
and disorder on board had shaken their discipline;
the movement of the ship and the darkness of the night had
cowed their spirits. They made a rush upon the pier; my
lord, with his sword drawn on his own retainers, must throw
himself in front; and this impulse of rabblement was not
restrained without a certain clamour of voices, highly to be
regretted in the case.</p>

<p>When some degree of order had been restored, Dick,
with a few chosen men, set forth in advance. The darkness
on shore, by contrast with the flashing of the surf, appeared
before him like a solid body; and the howling and whistling
of the gale drowned any lesser noise.</p>

<p>He had scarce reached the end of the pier, however, when
there fell a lull of the wind; and in this he seemed to hear
on shore the hollow footing of horses and the clash of arms.
Checking his immediate followers, he passed forward a step
or two alone, even setting foot upon the down; and here he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
made sure he could detect the shape of men and horses
moving. A strong discouragement assailed him. If their
enemies were really on the watch, if they had beleagured the
shoreward end of the pier, he and Lord Foxham were taken
in a posture of very poor defence, the sea behind, the men
jostled in the dark upon a narrow causeway. He gave a
cautious whistle, the signal previously agreed upon.</p>

<p>It proved to be a signal for more than he desired. Instantly
there fell, through the black night, a shower of arrows
sent at a venture; and so close were the men huddled on
the pier that more than one was hit, and the arrows were
answered with cries of both fear and pain. In this first discharge,
Lord Foxham was struck down; Hawksley had him
carried on board again at once; and his men, during the
brief remainder of the skirmish, fought (when they fought at
all) without guidance. That was perhaps the chief cause of
the disaster which made haste to follow.</p>

<p>At the shore end of the pier, for perhaps a minute, Dick
held his own with a handful; one or two were wounded
upon either side; steel crossed steel; nor had there been the
least signal of advantage, when in the twinkling of an eye
the tide turned against the party from the ship. Some one
cried out that all was lost; the men were in the very humour
to lend an ear to a discomfortable counsel; the cry was taken
up. &ldquo;On board, lads, for your lives!&rdquo; cried another. A
third, with the true instinct of the coward, raised that inevitable
report on all retreats: &ldquo;We are betrayed!&rdquo; And
in a moment the whole mass of men went surging and jostling
backward down the pier, turning their defenceless backs on
their pursuers and piercing the night with craven outcry.</p>

<p>One coward thrust off the ship&rsquo;s stern, while another still
held her by the bows. The fugitives leaped, screaming, and
were hauled on board, or fell back and perished in the sea.
Some were cut down upon the pier by the pursuers. Many
were injured on the ship&rsquo;s deck in the blind haste and terror
of the moment, one man leaping upon another, and a third
on both. At last, and whether by design or accident, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
bows of the <i>Good Hope</i> were liberated; and the ever-ready
Lawless, who had maintained his place at the helm through
all the hurly-burly by sheer strength of body and a liberal
use of the cold steel, instantly clapped her on the proper
tack. The ship began to move once more forward on the
stormy sea, its scuppers running blood, its deck heaped with
fallen men, sprawling and struggling in the dark.</p>

<p>Thereupon Lawless sheathed his dagger, and, turning
to his next neighbour, &ldquo;I have left my mark on them,
gossip,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the yelping, coward hounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, while they were all leaping and struggling for their
lives, the men had not appeared to observe the rough shoves
and cutting stabs with which Lawless had held his post in
the confusion. But perhaps they had already begun to
understand somewhat more clearly, perhaps another ear
had overheard the helmsman&rsquo;s speech.</p>

<p>Panic-stricken troops recover slowly, and men who have
just disgraced themselves by cowardice, as if to wipe out
the memory of their fault, will sometimes run straight into
the opposite extreme of insubordination. So it was now;
and the same men who had thrown away their weapons and
been hauled, feet foremost, into the <i>Good Hope</i>, began to cry
out upon their leaders, and demand that some one should be
punished.</p>

<p>This growing ill-feeling turned upon Lawless.</p>

<p>In order to get a proper offing, the old outlaw had put
the head of the <i>Good Hope</i> to seaward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; bawled one of the grumblers, &ldquo;he carrieth
us to seaward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sooth,&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;Nay, we are betrayed
for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they all began to cry out in chorus that they were
betrayed, and in shrill tones and with abominable oaths
bade Lawless go about-ship and bring them speedily ashore.</p>

<p>Lawless, grinding his teeth, continued in silence to steer
the true course, guiding the <i>Good Hope</i> among the formidable
billows. To their empty terrors, as to their dishonourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
threats, between drink and dignity he scorned to make reply.
The malcontents drew together a little abaft the mast, and
it was plain they were like barnyard cocks, &ldquo;crowing for
courage.&rdquo; Presently they would be fit for any extremity of
injustice or ingratitude. Dick began to mount by the ladder,
eager to interpose; but one of the outlaws, who was also
something of a seaman, got beforehand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lads,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are right wooden heads, I think.
For to get back, by the mass, we must have an offing, must
we not? And this old Lawless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one struck the speaker on the mouth, and the next
moment, as a fire springs among dry straw, he was felled upon
the deck, trampled under the feet, and despatched by the
daggers of his cowardly companions. At this the wrath of
Lawless rose and broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steer yourselves,&rdquo; he bellowed, with a curse; and,
careless of the result, he left the helm.</p>

<p>The <i>Good Hope</i> was, at that moment, trembling on the
summit of a swell. She subsided, with sickening velocity,
upon the farther side. A wave, like a great black bulwark,
hove immediately in front of her; and, with a staggering
blow, she plunged head foremost through that liquid hill.
The green water passed right over her from stem to stern,
as high as a man&rsquo;s knees; the sprays ran higher than the
mast; and she rose again upon the other side, with an appalling,
tremulous indecision, like a beast that has been
deadly wounded.</p>

<p>Six or seven of the malcontents had been carried bodily
overboard; and as for the remainder, when they found their
tongues again, it was to bellow to the saints and wail upon
Lawless to come back and take the tiller.</p>

<p>Nor did Lawless wait to be twice bidden. The terrible
result of his fling of just resentment sobered him completely.
He knew, better than any one on board, how nearly the
<i>Good Hope</i> had gone bodily down below their feet; and he
could tell, by the laziness with which she met the sea, that
the peril was by no means over.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span></p>

<p>Dick, who had been thrown down by the concussion and
half drowned, rose wading to his knees in the swamped well
of the stern, and crept to the old helmsman&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawless,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we do all depend on you; y&rsquo; are a
brave, steady man, indeed, and crafty in the management of
ships; I shall put three sure men to watch upon your safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bootless, my master, bootless,&rdquo; said the steersman,
peering forward through the dark. &ldquo;We come every
moment somewhat clearer of these sandbanks; with every
moment, then, the sea packeth upon us heavier, and for all
these whimperers, they will presently be on their backs.
For, my master, &rsquo;tis a right mystery, but true, there never
yet was a bad man that was a good shipman. None but
the honest and the bold can endure me this tossing of a ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Lawless,&rdquo; said Dick, laughing, &ldquo;that is a right
shipman&rsquo;s byword, and hath no more of sense than the
whistle of the wind. But, prithee, how go we? Do we lie
well? Are we in good case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; replied Lawless, &ldquo;I have been a Grey
Friar&mdash;I praise fortune&mdash;an archer, a thief, and a shipman.
Of all these coats, I had the best fancy to die in the Grey
Friars, as ye may readily conceive, and the least fancy to
die in John Shipman&rsquo;s tarry jacket; and that for two excellent
good reasons: first, that the death might take a man
suddenly; and second, for the horror of that great salt
smother and welter under my foot here&rdquo;&mdash;and Lawless
stamped with his foot. &ldquo;Howbeit,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;an I die
not a sailor&rsquo;s death, and that this night, I shall owe a tall
candle to our Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is right so,&rdquo; replied the outlaw. &ldquo;Do ye not feel
how heavy and dull she moves upon the waves? Do ye
not hear the water washing in her hold? She will scarce
mind the rudder even now. Bide till she has settled a bit
lower; and she will either go down below your boots like a
stone image, or drive ashore here, under our lee, and come
all to pieces like a twist of string.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak with a good courage,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;Ye
are not then appalled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, master,&rdquo; answered Lawless, &ldquo;if ever a man had
an ill crew to come to port with, it is I&mdash;a renegade friar, a
thief, and all the rest on&rsquo;t. Well, ye may wonder, but I
keep a good hope in my wallet; and if that I be to drown,
I will drown with a bright eye, Master Shelton, and a steady
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick returned no answer; but he was surprised to find
the old vagabond of so resolute a temper, and, fearing some
fresh violence or treachery, set forth upon his quest for three
sure men. The great bulk of the men had now deserted the
deck, which was continually wetted with the flying sprays,
and where they lay exposed to the shrewdness of the winter
wind. They had gathered, instead, into the hold of the
merchandise, among the butts of wine, and lighted by two
swinging lanterns.</p>

<p>Here a few kept up the form of revelry, and toasted each
other deep in Arblaster&rsquo;s Gascony wine. But as the <i>Good
Hope</i> continued to tear through the smoking waves, and
toss her stem and stern alternately high in air and deep into
white foam, the number of these jolly companions diminished
with every moment and with every lurch. Many sat apart,
tending their hurts, but the majority were already prostrated
with sickness, and lay moaning in the bilge.</p>

<p>Greensheve, Cuckow, and a young fellow of Lord Foxham&rsquo;s
whom Dick had already remarked for his intelligence
and spirit, were still, however, both fit to understand and
willing to obey. These Dick set as a bodyguard about the
person of the steersman, and then, with a last look at the
black sky and sea, he turned and went below into the cabin,
whither Lord Foxham had been carried by his servants.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE &ldquo;GOOD HOPE&rdquo; (<i>concluded</i>)</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> moans of the wounded baron blended with the wailing
of the ship&rsquo;s dog. The poor animal, whether he was merely
sick at heart to be separated from his friends, or whether
he indeed recognised some peril in the labouring of the ship,
raised his cries, like minute-guns, above the roar of wave and
weather; and the more superstitious of the men heard, in
these sounds, the knell of the <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Foxham had been laid in a berth, upon a fur cloak.
A little lamp burned dim before the Virgin in the bulkhead,
and by its glimmer Dick could see the pale countenance and
hollow eyes of the hurt man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sore hurt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come near to my side,
young Shelton; let there be one by me who, at least, is
gentle born; for after having lived nobly and richly all the
days of my life, this is a sad pass that I should get my hurt
in a little ferreting skirmish, and die here, in a foul, cold ship
upon the sea, among broken men and churls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I pray rather to the saints
that ye will recover you of your hurt, and come soon and
sound ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded his lordship. &ldquo;Come sound
ashore? There is, then, a question of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship laboureth&mdash;the sea is grievous and contrary,&rdquo;
replied the lad; &ldquo;and by what I can learn of my fellow that
steereth us, we shall do well, indeed, if we come dryshod to
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the baron gloomily, &ldquo;thus shall every
terror attend upon the passage of my soul! Sir, pray rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
to live hard, that ye may die easy, than to be fooled and
fluted all through life, as to the pipe and tabor, and, in the
last hour, be plunged among misfortunes! Howbeit, I have
that upon my mind that must not be delayed. We have no
priest aboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, then, to my secular interests,&rdquo; resumed Lord
Foxham: &ldquo;ye must be as good a friend to me dead, as I
found you a gallant enemy when I was living. I fall in an
evil hour for me, for England, and for them that trusted me.
My men are being brought by Hamley&mdash;he that was your
rival; they will rendezvous in the long room at Holywood;
this ring from off my finger will accredit you to represent
mine orders; and I shall write, besides, two words upon this
paper, bidding Hamley yield to you the damsel. Will ye
obey? I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my lord, what orders?&rdquo; inquired Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; quoth the baron, &ldquo;ay&mdash;the orders&rdquo;; and he
looked upon Dick with hesitation. &ldquo;Are ye Lancaster or
York?&rdquo; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shame to say it,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;I can scarce
clearly answer. But so much I think is certain: since I
serve with Ellis Duckworth, I serve the House of York.
Well, if that be so, I declare for York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;it is exceeding well.
For, truly, had ye said Lancaster, I wot not for the world
what I had done. But sith ye are for York, follow me. I
came hither but to watch these lords at Shoreby, while mine
excellent young lord, Richard of Gloucester,<a name="FnAnchor_1" id="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> prepareth a
sufficient force to fall upon and scatter them. I have made
me notes of their strength, what watch they keep, and how
they lie; and these I was to deliver to my young lord on
Sunday, an hour before noon, at St. Bride&rsquo;s Cross beside the
forest. This tryst I am not like to keep, but I pray you, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
courtesy, to keep it in my stead; and see that not pleasure,
nor pain, tempest, wound, nor pestilence withhold you from
the hour and place, for the welfare of England lieth upon
this cast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do soberly take this upon me,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;In so
far as in me lieth, your purpose shall be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; said the wounded man. &ldquo;My lord duke
shall order you further, and if ye obey him with spirit and
goodwill, then is your fortune made. Give me the lamp a little
nearer to mine eyes, till that I write these words for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wrote a note &ldquo;to his worshipful kinsman, Sir John
Hamley&rdquo;; and then a second, which he left without external
superscription.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is for the duke,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The word is &lsquo;England
and Edward,&rsquo; and the counter, &lsquo;England and York.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Joanna, my lord?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, ye must get Joanna how ye can,&rdquo; replied the
baron. &ldquo;I have named you for my choice in both these
letters; but ye must get her for yourself, boy. I have tried,
as ye see here before you, and have lost my life. More
could no man do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the wounded man began to be very weary;
and Dick, putting the precious papers in his bosom, bade
him be of good cheer, and left him to repose.</p>

<p>The day was beginning to break, cold and blue, with
flying squalls of snow. Close under the lee of the <i>Good
Hope</i>, the coast lay in alternate rocky headlands and sandy
bays; and farther inland the wooded hill-tops of Tunstall
showed along the sky. Both the wind and the sea had gone
down; but the vessel wallowed deep, and scarce rose upon
the waves.</p>

<p>Lawless was still fixed at the rudder; and by this time
nearly all the men had crawled on deck, and were now
gazing, with blank faces, upon the inhospitable coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going ashore?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Lawless, &ldquo;unless we get first to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just then the ship rose so languidly to meet a sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
and the water weltered so loudly in her hold, that Dick
involuntarily seized the steersman by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass!&rdquo; cried Dick, as the bows of the <i>Good
Hope</i> re-appeared above the foam, &ldquo;I thought we had
foundered, indeed; my heart was at my throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the waist, Greensheve, Hawksley, and the better men
of both companies were busy breaking up the deck to build
a raft; and to these Dick joined himself, working the harder
to drown the memory of his predicament. But, even as he
worked, every sea that struck the poor ship, and every one
of her dull lurches, as she tumbled wallowing among the
waves, recalled him with a horrid pang to the immediate
proximity of death.</p>

<p>Presently, looking up from his work, he saw that they
were close in below a promontory; a piece of ruinous cliff,
against the base of which the sea broke white and heavy,
almost overplumbed the deck; and, above that again, a
house appeared, crowning a down.</p>

<p>Inside the bay the seas ran gaily, raised the <i>Good Hope</i>
upon their foam-flecked shoulders, carried her beyond
the control of the steersman, and in a moment dropped
her with a great concussion on the sand, and began to break
over her, half-mast high, and roll her to and fro. Another
great wave followed, raised her again, and carried her yet
farther in; and then a third succeeded, and left her far inshore
of the more dangerous breakers, wedged upon a bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; cried Lawless, &ldquo;the saints have had a care
of us indeed. The tide ebbs; let us but sit down and drink
a cup of wine, and before half an hour ye may all march me
ashore as safe as on a bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A barrel was broached, and sitting in what shelter they
could find from the flying snow and spray, the shipwrecked
company handed the cup around, and sought to warm their
bodies and restore their spirits.</p>

<p>Dick, meanwhile, returned to Lord Foxham, who lay in
great perplexity and fear, the floor of his cabin washing
knee-deep in water, and the lamp, which had been his only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
light, broken and extinguished by the violence of the
blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said young Shelton, &ldquo;fear not at all; the
saints are plainly for us; the seas have cast us high upon a
shoal, and as soon as the tide hath somewhat ebbed, we may
walk ashore upon our feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before the vessel was sufficiently
deserted by the ebbing sea, and they could set forth for the
land, which appeared dimly before them through a veil of
driving snow.</p>

<p>Upon a hillock on one side of their way a party of men
lay huddled together, suspiciously observing the movements
of the new arrivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might draw near and offer us some comfort,&rdquo;
Dick remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, an they come not to us, let us even turn aside
to them,&rdquo; said Hawksley. &ldquo;The sooner we come to a good
fire and a dry bed, the better for my poor lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they had not moved far in the direction of the hillock
before the men, with one consent, rose suddenly to their
feet, and poured a flight of well-directed arrows on the shipwrecked
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back! back!&rdquo; cried his lordship. &ldquo;Beware, in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, that ye reply not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Greensheve, pulling an arrow from his
leather jack. &ldquo;We are in no posture to fight, it is certain,
being drenching wet, dog-weary, and three-parts frozen;
but, for the love of old England, what aileth them to shoot
thus cruelly on their poor country people in distress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They take us to be French pirates,&rdquo; answered Lord
Foxham. &ldquo;In these most troublesome and degenerate
days we cannot keep our own shores of England; but our
old enemies, whom we once chased on sea and land, do now
range at pleasure, robbing and slaughtering and burning.
It is the pity and reproach of this poor land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men upon the hillock lay, closely observing them,
while they trailed upward from the beach and wound inland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
among desolate sandhills; for a mile or so they even hung
upon the rear of the march, ready, at a sign, to pour another
volley on the weary and dispirited fugitives; and it was only
when, striking at length upon a firm high-road, Dick began
to call his men to some more martial order, that these jealous
guardians of the coast of England silently disappeared
among the snow. They had done what they desired; they
had protected their own homes and farms, their own families
and cattle; and, their private interest being thus secured,
it mattered not the weight of a straw to any one of them,
although the Frenchmen should carry blood and fire to
every other parish in the realm of England.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>THE DEN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> place where Dick had struck the line of a high-road was
not far from Holywood, and within nine or ten miles of
Shoreby-on-the-Till; and here, after making sure that they
were pursued no longer, the two bodies separated. Lord
Foxham&rsquo;s followers departed, carrying their wounded master
towards the comfort and security of the great abbey; and
Dick, as he saw them wind away and disappear in the thick
curtain of the falling snow, was left alone with near upon a
dozen outlaws, the last remainder of his troop of volunteers.</p>

<p>Some were wounded; one and all were furious at their
ill-success and long exposure; and though they were now
too cold and hungry to do more, they grumbled and cast
sullen looks upon their leaders. Dick emptied his purse
among them, leaving himself nothing; thanked them for
the courage they had displayed, though he could have found
it more readily in his heart to rate them for poltroonery; and
having thus somewhat softened the effect of his prolonged
misfortune, despatched them to find their way, either severally
or in pairs, to Shoreby and the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For his own part, influenced by what he had seen on
board of the <i>Good Hope</i>, he chose Lawless to be his companion
on the walk. The snow was falling, without pause or variation,
in one even, blinding cloud; the wind had been
strangled, and now blew no longer; and the whole world
was blotted out and sheeted down below that silent inundation.
There was great danger of wandering by the way and
perishing in drifts; and Lawless, keeping half a step in front
of his companion, and holding his head forward like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
hunting dog upon the scent, inquired his way of every tree,
and studied out their path as though he were conning a ship
among dangers.</p>

<p>About a mile into the forest they came to a place where
several ways met, under a grove of lofty and contorted oaks.
Even in the narrow horizon of the falling snow, it was a spot
that could not fail to be recognised; and Lawless evidently
recognised it with particular delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Master Richard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an y&rsquo; are not too
proud to be the guest of a man who is neither a gentleman
by birth nor so much as a good Christian, I can offer you a
cup of wine and a good fire to melt the marrow in your frozen
bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on, Will,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;A cup of wine and
a good fire! Nay, I would go a far way round to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawless turned aside under the bare branches of the
grove, and, walking resolutely forward for some time, came
to a steepish hollow or den, that had now drifted a quarter
full of snow. On the verge a great beech-tree hung, precariously
rooted; and here the old outlaw, pulling aside
some bushy underwood, bodily disappeared into the earth.</p>

<p>The beech had, in some violent gale, been half-uprooted,
and had torn up a considerable stretch of turf; and it was
under this that old Lawless had dug out his forest hiding-place.
The roots served him for rafters, the turf was his
thatch; for walls and floor he had his mother the earth.
Rude as it was, the hearth in one corner, blackened by fire,
and the presence in another of a large oaken chest well
fortified with iron, showed it at one glance to be the den of a
man, and not the burrow of a digging beast.</p>

<p>Though the snow had drifted at the mouth and sifted in
upon the floor of this earth-cavern, yet was the air much
warmer than without; and when Lawless had struck a
spark, and the dry furze bushes had begun to blaze and
crackle on the hearth, the place assumed, even to the eye,
an air of comfort and of home.</p>

<p>With a sigh of great contentment Lawless spread his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
broad hands before the fire, and seemed to breathe the
smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is this old Lawless&rsquo;s rabbit-hole;
pray Heaven there come no terrier! Far I have rolled
hither and thither, and here and about, since that I was
fourteen years of mine age, and first ran away from mine
abbey, with the sacrist&rsquo;s gold chain and a mass-book that
I sold for four marks. I have been in England and France
and Burgundy, and in Spain, too, on a pilgrimage for my
poor soul; and upon the sea, which is no man&rsquo;s country.
But here is my place, Master Shelton. This is my native
land, this burrow in the earth. Come rain or wind&mdash;an
whether it&rsquo;s April, and the birds all sing, and the blossoms
fall about my bed, or whether it&rsquo;s winter, and I sit alone with
my good gossip the fire, and robin-redbreast twitters in the
woods&mdash;here is my church and market, my wife and child.
It&rsquo;s here I come back to, and it&rsquo;s here, so please the saints,
that I would like to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a warm corner, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;and
a pleasant, and a well-hid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had need to be,&rdquo; returned Lawless, &ldquo;for an they
found it, Master Shelton, it would break my heart. But
here,&rdquo; he added, burrowing with his stout fingers in the sandy
floor, &ldquo;here is my wine-cellar, and ye shall have a flask of
excellent strong stingo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, after but a little digging, he produced a big
leathern bottle of about a gallon, nearly three parts full of a
very heady and sweet wine; and when they had drunk to
each other comradely, and the fire had been replenished and
blazed up again, the pair lay at full length, thawing and
steaming, and divinely warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton,&rdquo; observed the outlaw, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have had
two mischances this last while, and y&rsquo; are like to lose the
maid&mdash;do I take it aright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aright!&rdquo; returned Dick, nodding his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; continued Lawless, &ldquo;hear an old fool that
hath been nigh-hand everything, and seen nigh-hand all!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
Ye go too much on other people&rsquo;s errands, Master Dick.
Ye go on Ellis&rsquo;s; but he desireth rather the death of Sir
Daniel. Ye go on Lord Foxham&rsquo;s; well&mdash;the saints preserve
him!&mdash;doubtless he meaneth well. But go ye upon
your own, good Dick. Come right to the maid&rsquo;s side.
Court her, lest that she forget you. Be ready; and when
the chance shall come, off with her at the saddle-bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but, Lawless, beyond doubt she is now in Sir
Daniel&rsquo;s own mansion,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thither, then, go we,&rdquo; replied the outlaw.</p>

<p>Dick stared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I mean it,&rdquo; nodded Lawless. &ldquo;And if y&rsquo; are
of so little faith, and stumble at a word, see here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the outlaw, taking a key from about his neck,
opened the oak chest, and dipping and groping deep among
its contents, produced first a friar&rsquo;s robe, and next a girdle
of rope; and then a huge rosary of wood, heavy enough to be
counted as a weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is for you. On with them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, when Dick had clothed himself in this clerical
disguise, Lawless produced some colours and a pencil, and
proceeded, with the greatest cunning, to disguise his face.
The eyebrows he thickened and produced; to the moustache,
which was yet hardly visible, he rendered a like service;
while, by a few lines around his eye, he changed the expression
and increased the apparent age of this young monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;when I have done the like, we
shall make as bonny a pair of friars as the eye could wish.
Boldly to Sir Daniel&rsquo;s we shall go, and there be hospitably
welcome for the love of Mother Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how, dear Lawless,&rdquo; cried the lad, &ldquo;shall I repay
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, brother,&rdquo; replied the outlaw, &ldquo;I do naught but
for my pleasure. Mind not for me. I am one, by the mass,
that mindeth for himself. When that I lack, I have a long
tongue and a voice like the monastery bell&mdash;I do ask, my
son; and where asking faileth, I do most usually take.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span></p>

<p>The old rogue made a humorous grimace; and although
Dick was displeased to lie under so great favours to so
equivocal a personage, he was yet unable to restrain his
mirth.</p>

<p>With that Lawless returned to the big chest, and was
soon similarly disguised; but below his gown Dick wondered
to observe him conceal a sheaf of black arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore do ye that?&rdquo; asked the lad. &ldquo;Wherefore
arrows, when ye take no bow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Lawless lightly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis like there will be
heads broke&mdash;not to say backs&mdash;ere you and I win sound
from where we&rsquo;re going to; and if any fall, I would our
fellowship should come by the credit on&rsquo;t. A black arrow,
Master Dick, is the seal of our abbey; it showeth you who
writ the bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ye prepare so carefully,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I have here
some papers that, for mine own sake, and the interest of
those that trusted me, were better left behind than found
upon my body. Where shall I conceal them, Will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Lawless, &ldquo;I will go forth into the wood
and whistle me three verses of a song; meanwhile do you
bury them where ye please, and smooth the sand upon the
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;I trust you, man. I were
base indeed if I not trusted you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, y&rsquo; are but a child,&rdquo; replied the old outlaw,
pausing and turning his face upon Dick from the threshold of
the den. &ldquo;I am a kind old Christian, and no traitor to
men&rsquo;s blood, and no sparer of mine own in a friend&rsquo;s jeopardy.
But, fool child, I am a thief by trade and birth and habit.
If my bottle were empty and my mouth dry, I would rob
you, dear child, as sure as I love, honour, and admire your
parts and person! Can it be clearer spoken? No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he stumped forth through the bushes with a snap
of his big fingers.</p>

<p>Dick, thus left alone, after a wondering thought upon
the inconsistencies of his companion&rsquo;s character, hastily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
produced, reviewed, and buried his papers. One only he
reserved to carry along with him, since it in nowise compromised
his friends, and yet might serve him, in a pinch,
against Sir Daniel. That was the knight&rsquo;s own letter to
Lord Wensleydale, sent by Throgmorton, on the morrow of
the defeat at Risingham, and found next day by Dick upon
the body of the messenger.</p>

<p>Then, treading down the embers of the fire, Dick left
the den, and rejoined the old outlaw, who stood awaiting
him under the leafless oaks, and was already beginning to
be powdered by the falling snow. Each looked upon the
other, and each laughed, so thorough and so droll was the
disguise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I would it were but summer and a clear day,&rdquo;
grumbled the outlaw, &ldquo;that I might see myself in the mirror
of a pool. There be many of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s men that know
me; and if we fell to be recognised, there might be two words
for you, my brother, but as for me, in a paternoster-while,
I should be kicking in a rope&rsquo;s-end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus they set forth together along the road to Shoreby,
which, in this part of its course, kept near along the margin
of the forest, coming forth, from time to time, in the open
country, and passing beside poor folks&rsquo; houses and small
farms.</p>

<p>Presently at sight of one of these Lawless pulled up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother Martin,&rdquo; he said, in a voice capitally disguised,
and suited to his monkish robe, &ldquo;let us enter and seek alms
from these poor sinners. <i>Pax vobiscum!</i> Ay,&rdquo; he added,
in his own voice, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis as I feared: I have somewhat lost the
whine of it; and by your leave, good Master Shelton, ye
must suffer me to practise in these country places, before
that I risk my fat neck by entering Sir Daniel&rsquo;s. But look
ye a little, what an excellent thing it is to be a Jack-of-all-trades!
An I had not been a shipman, ye had infallibly
gone down in the <i>Good Hope</i>; an I had not been a thief, I
could not have painted me your face; and but that I had
been a Grey Friar, and sung loud in the choir, and ate hearty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
at the board, I could not have carried this disguise, but the
very dogs would have spied us out and barked at us for
shams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was by this time close to the window of the farm,
and he rose on his tip-toes and peeped in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;better and better. We shall here try
our false faces with a vengeance, and have a merry jest on
Brother Capper to boot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying he opened the door and led the way into
the house.</p>

<p>Three of their own company sat at the table, greedily
eating. Their daggers, stuck beside them in the board, and
the black and menacing looks which they continued to
shower upon the people of the house, proved that they owed
their entertainment rather to force than favour. On the
two monks, who now, with a sort of humble dignity, entered
the kitchen of the farm, they seemed to turn with a particular
resentment; and one&mdash;it was John Capper in person&mdash;who
seemed to play the leading part, instantly and rudely ordered
them away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want no beggars here!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>But another&mdash;although he was as far from recognising
Dick and Lawless&mdash;inclined to more moderate counsels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We be strong men, and take:
these be weak, and crave; but in the latter end these shall
be uppermost and we below.&mdash;Mind him not, my father;
but come, drink of my cup, and give me a benediction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are men of a light mind, carnal and accursed,&rdquo; said
the monk. &ldquo;Now, may the saints forbid that ever I should
drink with such companions! But here, for the pity I bear
to sinners, here I do&rsquo; leave you a blessed relic, the which, for
your soul&rsquo;s interest, I bid you kiss and cherish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far Lawless thundered upon them like a preaching
friar; but with these words he drew from under his robe
a black arrow, tossed it on the board in front of the three
startled outlaws, turned in the same instant, and, taking
Dick along with him, was out of the room and out of sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
among the falling snow before they had time to utter a word
or move a finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have proved our false faces, Master
Shelton. I will now adventure my poor carcass where ye
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; returned Richard. &ldquo;It irks me to be doing.
Set we on for Shoreby!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>&ldquo;IN MINE ENEMIES&rsquo; HOUSE&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Sir Daniel&rsquo;s</span> residence in Shoreby was a tall, commodious,
plastered mansion, framed in carven oak, and covered by a
low-pitched roof of thatch. To the back there stretched a
garden, full of fruit-trees, alleys, and thick arbours, and over-looked
from the far end by the tower of the abbey church.</p>

<p>The house might contain, upon a pinch, the retinue of
a greater person than Sir Daniel; but even now it was filled
with hubbub. The court rang with arms and horse-shoe
iron; the kitchen roared with cookery like a bees&rsquo;-hive;
minstrels, and the players of instruments, and the cries of
tumblers, sounded from the hall. Sir Daniel, in his profusion,
in the gaiety and gallantry of his establishment,
rivalled with Lord Shoreby and eclipsed Lord Risingham.</p>

<p>All guests were made welcome. Minstrels, tumblers,
players of chess, the sellers of relics, medicines, perfumes
and enchantments, and along with these every sort of priest,
friar, or pilgrim, were made welcome to the lower table, and
slept together in the ample lofts, or on the bare boards of
the long dining-hall.</p>

<p>On the afternoon following the wreck of the <i>Good Hope</i>,
the buttery, the kitchens, the stables, the covered cart-shed
that surrounded two sides of the court, were all crowded by
idle people, partly belonging to Sir Daniel&rsquo;s establishment,
and attired in his livery of murrey and blue, partly nondescript
strangers attracted to the town by greed, and received
by the knight through policy, and because it was the fashion
of the time.</p>

<p>The snow, which still fell without interruption, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
extreme chill of the air, and the approach of night, combined
to keep them under shelter. Wine, ale, and money were all
plentiful; many sprawled gambling in the straw of the barn,
many were still drunken from the noontide meal. To the
eye of a modern it would have looked like the sack of a city;
to the eye of a contemporary it was like any other rich and
noble household at a festive season.</p>

<p>Two monks&mdash;a young and an old&mdash;had arrived late, and
were now warming themselves at a bonfire in a corner of the
shed. A mixed crowd surrounded them&mdash;jugglers, mountebanks,
and soldiers: and with these the elder of the two had
soon engaged so brisk a conversation, and exchanged so
many loud guffaws and country witticisms that the group
momentarily increased in number.</p>

<p>The younger companion, in whom the reader has already
recognised Dick Shelton, sat from the first somewhat backward,
and gradually drew himself away. He listened,
indeed, closely, but he opened not his mouth; and by the
grave expression of his countenance he made but little
account of his companion&rsquo;s pleasantries.</p>

<p>At last his eye, which travelled continually to and fro,
and kept a guard upon all the entrances of the house, lit
upon a little procession entering by the main gate and
crossing the court in an oblique direction. Two ladies,
muffled in thick furs, led the way, and were followed by a
pair of waiting-women and four stout men-at-arms. The
next moment they had disappeared within the house; and
Dick, slipping through the crowd of loiterers in the shed,
was already giving hot pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The taller of these twain was Lady Brackley,&rdquo; he
thought; &ldquo;and where Lady Brackley is, Joan will not be
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the door of the house the four men-at-arms had
ceased to follow, and the ladies were now mounting the stairway
of polished oak, under no better escort than that of the
two waiting-women. Dick followed close behind. It was
already the dusk of the day; and in the house the darkness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
of the night had almost come. On the stair-landings torches
flared in iron holders; down the long tapestried corridors
a lamp burned by every door. And where the door stood
open, Dick could look in upon arras-covered walls, and rush-bescattered
floors, glowing in the light of the wood-fires.</p>

<p>Two floors were passed, and at every landing the younger
and shorter of the two ladies had looked back keenly at the
monk. He, keeping his eyes lowered, and affecting the
demure manners that suited his disguise, had but seen her
once, and was unaware that he had attracted her attention.
And now, on the third floor, the party separated, the younger
lady continuing to ascend alone, the other, followed by the
waiting-maids, descending the corridor to the right.</p>

<p>Dick mounted with a swift foot, and holding to the
corner, thrust forth his head and followed the three women
with his eyes. Without turning or looking behind them,
they continued to descend the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is right well,&rdquo; thought Dick. &ldquo;Let me but know
my Lady Brackley&rsquo;s chamber, and it will go hard an I find
not Dame Hatch upon an errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just then a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and,
with a bound and a choked cry, he turned to grapple his
assailant.</p>

<p>He was somewhat abashed to find, in the person whom
he had so roughly seized, the short young lady in the furs.
She, on her part, was shocked and terrified beyond expression,
and hung trembling in his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dick, releasing her, &ldquo;I cry you a thousand
pardons; but I have no eyes behind, and, by the mass,
I could not tell ye were a maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl continued to look at him, but, by this time, terror
began to be succeeded by surprise, and surprise by suspicion.
Dick, who could read these changes on her face, became
alarmed for his own safety in that hostile house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair maid,&rdquo; he said, affecting easiness, &ldquo;suffer me to
kiss your hand, in token ye forgive my roughness, and I will
even go.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are a strange monk, young sir,&rdquo; returned the young
lady, looking him both boldly and shrewdly in the face;
&ldquo;and now that my first astonishment hath somewhat passed
away, I can spy the layman in each word you utter. What
do ye here? Why are ye thus sacrilegiously tricked out?
Come ye in peace or war? And why spy ye after Lady
Brackley like a thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; quoth Dick, &ldquo;of one thing I pray you to be
very sure: I am no thief. And even if I come here in war,
as in some degree I do, I make no war upon fair maids, and
I hereby entreat them to copy me so far, and to leave me be.
For, indeed, fair mistress, cry out&mdash;if such be your pleasure&mdash;cry
but once, and say what ye have seen, and the poor
gentleman before you is merely a dead man. I cannot think
ye would be cruel,&rdquo; added Dick; and taking the girl&rsquo;s hand
gently in both of his, he looked at her with courteous admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye then a spy&mdash;a Yorkist?&rdquo; asked the maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am indeed a Yorkist, and in
some sort, a spy. But that which bringeth me into this
house, the same which will win for me the pity and interest
of your kind heart, is neither of York nor Lancaster. I will
wholly put my life in your discretion. I am a lover, and
my name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here the young lady clapped her hand suddenly upon
Dick&rsquo;s mouth, looked hastily up and down and east and
west, and, seeing the coast clear, began to drag the young
man, with great strength and vehemence, upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and come. &rsquo;Shalt talk hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somewhat bewildered, Dick suffered himself to be pulled
upstairs, bustled along a corridor, and thrust suddenly into
a chamber, lit, like so many of the others, by a blazing log
upon the hearth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the young lady, forcing him down upon a
stool, &ldquo;sit ye there and attend my sovereign good-pleasure.
I have life and death over you, and I will not scruple to
abuse my power. Look to yourself; y&rsquo; have cruelly mauled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
my arm. He knew not I was a maid, quoth he! Had he
known I was a maid, he had ta&rsquo;en his belt to me, forsooth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with these words she whipped out of the room, and
left Dick gaping with wonder, and not very sure if he were
dreaming or awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ta&rsquo;en my belt to her!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ta&rsquo;en my
belt to her!&rdquo; and the recollection of that evening in the
forest flowed back upon his mind, and he once more saw
Matcham&rsquo;s wincing body and beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>And then he was recalled to the dangers of the present.
In the next room he heard a stir, as of a person moving;
then followed a sigh, which sounded strangely near; and
then the rustle of skirts and tap of feet once more began.
As he stood hearkening, he saw the arras wave along the
wall; there was the sound of a door being opened, the
hangings divided, and, lamp in hand, Joanna Sedley entered
the apartment.</p>

<p>She was attired in costly stuffs of deep and warm colours,
such as befit the winter and the snow. Upon her head, her
hair had been gathered together and became her as a crown.
And she, who had seemed so little and so awkward in the
attire of Matcham, was now tall like a young willow, and
swam across the floor as though she scorned the drudgery
of walking.</p>

<p>Without a start, without a tremor, she raised her lamp
and looked at the young monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What make ye here, good brother?&rdquo; she inquired.
&ldquo;Ye are doubtless ill-directed. Whom do ye require?&rdquo;
And she set her lamp upon the bracket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joanna,&rdquo; said Dick; and then his voice failed him.
&ldquo;Joanna,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;ye said ye loved me; and the
more fool I, but I believed it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, to the wonder of the lad, this beautiful and
tall young lady made but one step of it, and threw her arms
about his neck and gave him a hundred kisses all in
one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O the fool fellow!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;O dear Dick! O,
if ye could see yourself! Alack!&rdquo; she added, pausing, &ldquo;I
have spoilt you, Dick! I have knocked some of the paint
off. But that can be mended. What cannot be mended,
Dick&mdash;or I much fear it cannot!&mdash;is my marriage with Lord
Shoreby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it decided then?&rdquo; asked the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, before noon, Dick, in the abbey church,&rdquo;
she answered, &ldquo;John Matcham and Joanna Sedley both
shall come to a right miserable end. There is no help in
tears, or I could weep mine eyes out. I have not spared
myself to pray, but Heaven frowns on my petition. And,
dear Dick&mdash;good Dick&mdash;but that ye can get me forth of
this house before the morning, we must even kiss and say
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;not I; I will never say that word.
&rsquo;Tis like despair; but while there&rsquo;s life, Joanna, there is
hope. Yet will I hope. Ay, by the mass, and triumph!
Look ye, now, when ye were but a name to me, did I not
follow&mdash;did I not rouse good men&mdash;did I not stake my life
upon the quarrel? And now that I have seen you for what
ye are&mdash;the fairest maid and stateliest of England&mdash;think
ye I would turn?&mdash;if the deep sea were there, I would straight
through it; if the way were full of lions, I would scatter them
like mice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;ye make a great ado about a
sky-blue robe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Joan,&rdquo; protested Dick, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not alone the robe.
But, lass, ye were disguised. Here am I disguised; and,
to the proof, do I not cut a figure of fun&mdash;a right fool&rsquo;s
figure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Dick, an&rsquo; that ye do!&rdquo; she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; he returned, triumphant. &ldquo;So was it
with you, poor Matcham, in the forest. In sooth, ye were
a wench to laugh at. But now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they ran on, holding each other by both hands, exchanging
smiles and lovely looks, and melting minutes into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
seconds; and so they might have continued all night long.
But presently there was a noise behind them; and they
were aware of the short young lady, with her finger on her
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saints!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but what a noise ye keep! Can
ye not speak in compass?&mdash;And now, Joanna, my fair maid
of the woods, what will ye give your gossip for bringing you
your sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joanna ran to her, by way of answer, and embraced her
fierily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, sir,&rdquo; added the young lady, &ldquo;what do ye
give me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I would fain offer to pay you
in the same money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;it is permitted
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick, blushing like a peony, only kissed her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails ye at my face, fair sir?&rdquo; she inquired,
curtseying to the very ground; and then, when Dick had
at length and most tepidly embraced her, &ldquo;Joanna,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;your sweetheart is very backward under your eyes;
but I warrant you, when first we met, he was more ready.
I am all black and blue, wench; trust me never, if I
be not black and blue! And now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;have
ye said your sayings? for I must speedily dismiss the
paladin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this they both cried out that they had said nothing,
that the night was still very young, and that they
would not be separated so early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And supper?&rdquo; asked the young lady. &ldquo;Must we
not go down to supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, to be sure!&rdquo; cried Joan. &ldquo;I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hide me, then,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;put me behind the arras,
shut me in a chest, or what ye will, so that I may be here
on your return. Indeed, fair lady,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;bear this
in mind, that we are sore bestead, and may never look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
upon each other&rsquo;s face from this night forward till we
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the young lady melted; and when, a little after,
the bell summoned Sir Daniel&rsquo;s household to the board,
Dick was planted very stiffly against the wall, at a place
where a division in the tapestry permitted him to breathe
the more freely, and even to see into the room.</p>

<p>He had not been long in this position when he was somewhat
strangely disturbed. The silence in that upper story
of the house was only broken by the flickering of the flames
and the hissing of a green log in the chimney; but presently,
to Dick&rsquo;s strained hearing, there came the sound of some one
walking with extreme precaution; and soon after the door
opened, and a little black-faced, dwarfish fellow, in Lord
Shoreby&rsquo;s colours, pushed first his head and then his crooked
body into the chamber. His mouth was open, as though
to hear the better; and his eyes, which were very bright,
flitted restlessly and swiftly to and fro. He went round and
round the room, striking here and there upon the hangings;
but Dick, by a miracle, escaped his notice. Then he looked
below the furniture, and examined the lamp; and at last,
with an air of cruel disappointment, was preparing to go
away as silently as he had come, when down he dropped
upon his knees, picked up something from among the rushes
on the floor, examined it, and, with every signal of delight,
concealed it in the wallet at his belt.</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s heart sank, for the object in question was a tassel
from his own girdle; and it was plain to him that this
dwarfish spy, who took a malign delight in his employment,
would lose no time in bearing it to his master, the baron.
He was half-tempted to throw aside the arras, fall upon the
scoundrel, and, at the risk of his life, remove the tell-tale
token. And while he was still hesitating, a new cause of
concern was added. A voice, hoarse and broken by drink,
began to be audible from the stair; and presently after, uneven,
wandering, and heavy footsteps sounded without along
the passage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What make ye here, my merry men, among the greenwood
shaws?&rdquo; sang the voice. &ldquo;What make ye here?
Hey! sots, what make ye here?&rdquo; it added, with a rattle of
drunken laughter; and then once more breaking into
song:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;If ye should drink the clary wine,</p>
<p class="i05">Fat Friar John, ye friend o&rsquo; mine&mdash;</p>
<p class="i05">If I should eat, and ye should drink,</p>
<p class="i05">Who shall sing the mass, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Lawless, alas! rolling drunk, was wandering the house,
seeking for a corner wherein to slumber off the effect of his
potations. Dick inwardly raged. The spy, at first terrified,
had grown reassured as he found he had to deal with an
intoxicated man, and now, with a movement of cat-like
rapidity, slipped from the chamber, and was gone from
Richard&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>What was to be done? If he lost touch of Lawless for
the night he was left impotent, whether to plan or carry forth
Joanna&rsquo;s rescue. If, on the other hand, he dared to address
the drunken outlaw, the spy might still be lingering within
sight, and the most fatal consequences ensue.</p>

<p>It was, nevertheless, upon this last hazard that Dick
decided. Slipping from behind the tapestry, he stood ready
in the doorway of the chamber, with a warning hand upraised.
Lawless, flushed crimson, with his eyes injected,
vacillating on his feet, drew still unsteadily nearer. At
last he hazily caught sight of his commander, and, in despite
of Dick&rsquo;s imperious signals, hailed him instantly and
loudly by his name.</p>

<p>Dick leaped upon and shook the drunkard furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beast!&rdquo; he hissed&mdash;&ldquo;beast, and no man! It is worse
than treachery to be so witless. We may all be shent for
thy sotting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lawless only laughed and staggered, and tried to
clap young Shelton on the back.</p>

<p>And just then Dick&rsquo;s quick ear caught a rapid brushing
in the arras. He leaped towards the sound, and the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
moment a piece of the wall-hanging had been torn down,
and Dick and the spy were sprawling together in its folds.
Over and over they rolled, grappling for each other&rsquo;s throat,
and still baffled by the arras, and still silent in their deadly
fury. But Dick was by much the stronger, and soon the
spy lay prostrate under his knee, and, with a single stroke
of the long poniard, ceased to breathe.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE DEAD SPY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> this furious and rapid passage, Lawless had
looked on helplessly, and even when all was over, and Dick,
already re-arisen to his feet, was listening with the most
passionate attention to the distant bustle in the lower stories
of the house, the old outlaw was still wavering on his legs
like a shrub in a breeze of wind, and still stupidly staring
on the face of the dead man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Dick at length; &ldquo;they have not heard
us, praise the saints! But, now, what shall I do with this
poor spy? At least, I will take my tassel from his wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Dick opened the wallet; within he found a
few pieces of money, the tassel, and a letter addressed to
Lord Wensleydale, and sealed with my Lord Shoreby&rsquo;s seal.
The name awoke Dick&rsquo;s recollection; and he instantly
broke the wax and read the contents of the letter. It was
short, but, to Dick&rsquo;s delight, it gave evident proof that Lord
Shoreby was treacherously corresponding with the House
of York.</p>

<p>The young fellow usually carried his ink-horn and implements
about him, and so now, bending a knee beside the
body of the dead spy, he was able to write these words upon
a corner of the paper:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;My Lord of Shoreby, ye that writt the letter, wot ye why your
man is ded? But let me rede you, marry not.</p>

<p class="rt sc">&ldquo;Jon Amend-All.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He laid this paper on the breast of the corpse; and then
Lawless, who had been looking on upon these last manoeuvres
with some flickering returns of intelligence, suddenly drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
a black arrow from below his robe, and therewith pinned the
paper in its place. The sight of this disrespect, or, as it
almost seemed, cruelty to the dead, drew a cry of horror
from young Shelton; but the old outlaw only laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I will have the credit for mine order,&rdquo; he hiccuped.
&ldquo;My jolly boys must have the credit on&rsquo;t&mdash;the credit,
brother&rdquo;; and then, shutting his eyes tight and opening
his mouth like a precentor, he began to thunder, in a formidable
voice:</p>

<p class="center1 f90">&ldquo;If ye should drink the clary wine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, sot!&rdquo; cried Dick, and thrust him hard against
the wall. &ldquo;In two words&mdash;if so be that such a man can
understand me who hath more wine than wit in him&mdash;in two
words, and a-Mary&rsquo;s name, begone out of this house, where,
if ye continue to abide, ye will not only hang yourself, but
me also! Faith, then, up foot! be yare, or, by the mass,
I may forget that I am in some sort your captain, and in
some your debtor! Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sham monk was now, in some degree, recovering
the use of his intelligence; and the ring in Dick&rsquo;s voice, and
the glitter in Dick&rsquo;s eye, stamped home the meaning of his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass,&rdquo; cried Lawless, &ldquo;an I be not wanted,
I can go&rdquo;; and he turned tipsily along the corridor and proceeded
to flounder downstairs, lurching against the wall.</p>

<p>So soon as he was out of sight, Dick returned to his
hiding-place, resolutely fixed to see the matter out. Wisdom,
indeed, moved him to be gone; but love and curiosity
were stronger.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly for the young man, bolt upright behind
the arras. The fire in the room began to die down,
and the lamp to burn low and to smoke. And still there
was no word of the return of any one to these upper quarters
of the house; still the faint hum and clatter of the supper-party
sounded from far below; and still, under the thick
fall of the snow, Shoreby town lay silent upon every side.</p>

<p>At length, however, feet and voices began to draw near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
upon the stair; and presently after several of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s
guests arrived upon the landing, and, turning down the
corridor, beheld the torn arras and the body of the spy.</p>

<p>Some ran forward and some back, and all together began
to cry aloud.</p>

<p>At the sound of their cries, guests, men-at-arms, ladies,
servants, and, in a word, all the inhabitants of that great
house, came flying from every direction, and began to join
their voices to the tumult.</p>

<p>Soon a way was cleared, and Sir Daniel came forth in
person, followed by the bridegroom of the morrow, my Lord
Shoreby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel, &ldquo;have I not told you of this
knave Black Arrow? To the proof, behold it! There it
stands, and, by the rood, my gossip, in a man of yours, or
one that stole your colours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In good sooth, it was a man of mine,&rdquo; replied Lord
Shoreby, hanging back. &ldquo;I would I had more such. He
was as keen as a beagle and secret as a mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, gossip, truly?&rdquo; asked Sir Daniel keenly. &ldquo;An
what came he smelling up so many stairs in my poor mansion?
But he will smell no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please you, Sir Daniel,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;here is a paper
written upon with some matter, pinned upon his breast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it me, arrow and all,&rdquo; said the knight. And when
he had taken into his hand the shaft, he continued for some
time to gaze upon it in a sullen musing. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said,
addressing Lord Shoreby, &ldquo;here is a hate that followeth
hard and close upon my heels. This black stick, or its just
likeness, shall yet bring me down. And, gossip, suffer a
plain knight to counsel you; and if these hounds begin to
wind you, flee! &rsquo;Tis like a sickness&mdash;it still hangeth,
hangeth upon the limbs. But let us see what they have
written. It is as I thought, my lord; y&rsquo; are marked like an
old oak, by the woodman; to-morrow or next day, by will
come the axe. But what wrote ye in a letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Shoreby snatched the paper from the arrow, read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
it, crumpled it between his hands, and, overcoming the reluctance
which had hitherto withheld him from approaching,
threw himself on his knees beside the body and eagerly
groped in the wallet.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet with a somewhat unsettled countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gossip,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have indeed lost a letter here that
much imported; and could I lay my hand upon the knave
that took it, he should incontinently grace a halter. But
let us, first of all, secure the issues of the house. Here is
enough harm already, by St. George!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sentinels were posted close around the house and garden;
a sentinel on every landing of the stair, a whole troop in the
main entrance-hall; and yet another about the bonfire in
the shed. Sir Daniel&rsquo;s followers were supplemented by
Lord Shoreby&rsquo;s; there was thus no lack of men or weapons
to make the house secure, or to entrap a lurking enemy,
should one be there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the body of the spy was carried out through
the falling snow and deposited in the abbey church.</p>

<p>It was not until these dispositions had been taken, and
all had returned to a decorous silence, that the two girls
drew Richard Shelton from his place of concealment, and
made a full report to him of what had passed. He, upon his
side, recounted the visit of the spy, his dangerous discovery,
and speedy end.</p>

<p>Joanna leaned back very faint against the curtained
wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will avail but little,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall be wed to-morrow
in the morning, after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried her friend. &ldquo;And here is our paladin
that driveth lions like mice. Ye have little faith, of a
surety.&mdash;But come, friend lion-driver, give us some comfort;
speak, and let us hear bold counsels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was confounded to be thus outfaced with his own
exaggerated words; but though he coloured, he still spoke
stoutly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are in straits. Yet, could I but
win out of this house for half an hour, I do honestly tell myself
that all might still go well; and for the marriage, it
should be prevented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for the lions,&rdquo; mimicked the girl, &ldquo;they shall be
driven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I crave your excuse,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I speak not now
in any boasting humour, but rather as one inquiring after
help or counsel; for if I get not forth of this house through
these sentinels, I can do less than naught. Take me, I
pray you, rightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why said ye he was rustic, Joan?&rdquo; the girl inquired.
&ldquo;I warrant he hath a tongue in his head; ready, soft,
and bold is his speech at pleasure. What would ye
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; sighed Joanna, with a smile, &ldquo;they have changed
me my friend Dick, &rsquo;tis sure enough. When I beheld him,
he was rough indeed. But it matters little; there is no
help for my hard case, and I must still be Lady Shoreby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I will even make the adventure.
A friar is not much regarded; and if I found
a good fairy to lead me up, I may find another belike to
carry me down. How call they the name of this spy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rutter,&rdquo; said the young lady; &ldquo;and an excellent good
name to call him by. But how mean ye, lion-driver?
What is in your mind to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To offer boldly to go forth,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;and if
any stop me, to keep an unchanged countenance, and say
I go to pray for Rutter. They will be praying over his poor
clay even now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The device is somewhat simple,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;yet
it may hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said young Shelton, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no device, but mere
boldness, which serveth often better in great straits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye say true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, go, a-Mary&rsquo;s name,
and may Heaven speed you! Ye leave here a poor maid that
loves you entirely, and another that is most heartily your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
friend. Be wary, for their sakes, and make not shipwreck
of your safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; added Joanna, &ldquo;go, Dick. Ye run no more peril,
whether ye go or stay. Go; ye take my heart with you;
the saints defend you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick passed the first sentry with so assured a countenance
that the fellow merely fidgeted and stared; but at the
second landing the man carried his spear across and bade
him name his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Pax vobiscum</i>,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;I go to pray over
the body of this poor Rutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; returned the sentry; &ldquo;but to go alone
is not permitted you.&rdquo; He leaned over the oaken balusters
and whistled shrill. &ldquo;One cometh!&rdquo; he cried; and then
motioned Dick to pass.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stair he found the guard afoot and
awaiting his arrival; and when he had once more repeated
his story, the commander of the post ordered four men to
accompany him to the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him not slip, my lads,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring him to
Sir Oliver, on your lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was then opened; one of the men took Dick
by either arm, another marched ahead with a link, and the
fourth, with bent bow and the arrow on the string, brought
up the rear. In this order they proceeded through the
garden, under the thick darkness of the night and the scattering
snow, and drew near to the dimly-illuminated windows
of the abbey church.</p>

<p>At the western portal a picket of archers stood, taking
what shelter they could find in the hollow of the arched doorways,
and all powdered with the snow; and it was not until
Dick&rsquo;s conductors had exchanged a word with these, that
they were suffered to pass forth and enter the nave of the
sacred edifice.</p>

<p>The church was doubtfully lighted by the tapers upon
the great altar, and by a lamp or two that swung from the
arched roof before the private chapels of illustrious families.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
In the midst of the choir the dead spy lay, his limbs piously
composed, upon a bier.</p>

<p>A hurried mutter of prayer sounded along the arches;
cowled figures knelt in the stalls of the choir; and on the
steps of the high altar a priest in pontifical vestments
celebrated mass.</p>

<p>Upon this fresh entrance, one of the cowled figures arose,
and, coming down the steps which elevated the level of the
choir above that of the nave, demanded from the leader of
the four men what business brought him to the church. Out
of respect for the service and the dead, they spoke in guarded
tones; but the echoes of that huge empty building caught
up their words, and hollowly repeated and repeated them
along the aisles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A monk!&rdquo; returned Sir Oliver (for he it was), when
he had heard the report of the archer. &ldquo;My brother, I
looked not for your coming,&rdquo; he added, turning to young
Shelton. &ldquo;In all civility, who are ye? and at whose instance
do ye join your supplications to ours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick, keeping his cowl about his face, signed to Sir Oliver
to move a pace or two aside from the archers; and, so soon
as the priest had done so, &ldquo;I cannot hope to deceive you,
sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My life is in your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver violently started; his stout cheeks grew pale,
and for a space he was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what brings you here, I know not;
but I much misdoubt it to be evil. Nevertheless, for the
kindness that was, I would not willingly deliver you to harm.
Ye shall sit all night beside me in the stalls: ye shall sit there
till my Lord of Shoreby be married, and the party gone safe
home; and if all goeth well, and ye have planned no evil,
in the end ye shall go whither ye will. But if your purpose
be bloody, it shall return upon your head. Amen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the priest devoutly crossed himself, and turned and
louted to the altar.</p>

<p>With that he spoke a few words more to the soldiers,
and taking Dick by the hand, led him up to the choir, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
placed him in the stall beside his own, where, for mere
decency, the lad had instantly to kneel and appear to be
busy with his devotions.</p>

<p>His mind and his eyes, however, were continually wandering.
Three of the soldiers, he observed, instead of returning
to the house, had got them quietly into a point of vantage
in the aisle; and he could not doubt that they had done so
by Sir Oliver&rsquo;s command. Here, then, he was trapped.
Here he must spend the night in the ghostly glimmer and
shadow of the church, and looking on the pale face of him
he slew; and here, in the morning, he must see his sweetheart
married to another man before his eyes.</p>

<p>But, for all that, he obtained a command upon his mind,
and built himself up in patience to await the issue.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>IN THE ABBEY CHURCH</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> Shoreby Abbey Church the prayers were kept up all night
without cessation, now with the singing of psalms, now with
a note or two upon the bell.</p>

<p>Rutter, the spy, was nobly waked. There he lay, meanwhile,
as they had arranged him, his dead hands crossed
upon his bosom, his dead eyes staring on the roof; and hard
by, in the stall, the lad who had slain him waited, in sore
disquietude, the coming of the morning.</p>

<p>Once only, in the course of the hours, Sir Oliver leaned
across to his captive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;my son, if ye mean me evil,
I will certify, on my soul&rsquo;s welfare, ye design upon an innocent
man. Sinful in the eye of Heaven I do declare myself,
but sinful as against you I am not, neither have been ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; returned Dick, in the same tone of voice,
&ldquo;trust me, I design nothing; but as for your innocence, I
may not forget that ye cleared yourself but lamely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man may be innocently guilty,&rdquo; replied the priest.
&ldquo;He may be set blindfolded upon a mission, ignorant of
its true scope. So it was with me. I did decoy your father
to his death; but as Heaven sees us in this sacred place, I
knew not what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;But see what a strange
web ye have woven, that I should be, at this hour, at once
your prisoner and your judge; that ye should both threaten
my days and deprecate my anger. Methinks, if ye had been
all your life a true man and good priest, ye would neither
thus fear nor thus detest me. And now to your prayers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
I do obey you, since needs must; but I will not be burthened
with your company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest uttered a sigh so heavy that it had almost
touched the lad into some sentiment of pity, and he bowed
his head upon his hands like a man borne down below a
weight of care. He joined no longer in the psalms; but
Dick could hear the beads rattle through his fingers and the
prayers a-pattering between his teeth.</p>

<p>Yet a little, and the grey of the morning began to struggle
through the painted casements of the church, and to put to
shame the glimmer of the tapers. The light slowly broadened
and brightened, and presently through the south-eastern
clerestories a flush of rosy sunlight flickered on the
walls. The storm was over; the great clouds had disburdened
their snow and fled farther on, and the new day
was breaking on a merry winter landscape sheathed in white.</p>

<p>A bustle of church officers followed; the bier was carried
forth to the dead-house, and the stains of blood were cleansed
from off the tiles, that no such ill-omened spectacle should
disgrace the marriage of Lord Shoreby. At the same time,
the very ecclesiastics who had been so dismally engaged
all night began to put on morning faces, to do honour to
the merrier ceremony which was about to follow. And
further to announce the coming of the day, the pious of
the town began to assemble and fall to prayer before their
favourite shrines, or wait their turn at the confessionals.</p>

<p>Favoured by this stir, it was of course easily possible
for any man to avoid the vigilance of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s sentries
at the door; and presently Dick, looking about him wearily,
caught the eye of no less a person than Will Lawless, still
in his monk&rsquo;s habit.</p>

<p>The outlaw, at the same moment, recognised his leader,
and privily signed to him with hand and eye.</p>

<p>Now, Dick was far from having forgiven the old rogue
his most untimely drunkenness, but he had no desire to
involve him in his own predicament; and he signalled back
to him, as plain as he was able, to be gone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span></p>

<p>Lawless, as though he had understood, disappeared at
once behind a pillar, and Dick breathed again.</p>

<p>What, then, was his dismay to feel himself plucked by
the sleeve and to find the old robber installed beside him,
upon the next seat, and, to all appearance, plunged in his
devotions!</p>

<p>Instantly Sir Oliver arose from his place, and, gliding
behind the stalls, made for the soldiers in the aisle. If the
priest&rsquo;s suspicions had been so lightly wakened, the harm
was already done, and Lawless a prisoner in the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move not,&rdquo; whispered Dick. &ldquo;We are in the plaguiest
pass, thanks, before all things, to thy swinishness of yester-even.
When ye saw me here, so strangely seated, where
I have neither right nor interest, what a murrain! could ye
not smell harm and get ye gone from evil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Lawless, &ldquo;I thought ye had heard
from Ellis, and were here on duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellis!&rdquo; echoed Dick. &ldquo;Is Ellis then returned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For sure,&rdquo; replied the outlaw. &ldquo;He came last night,
and belted me sore for being in wine&mdash;so there ye are
avenged, my master. A furious man is Ellis Duckworth!
He hath ridden me hot-spur from Craven to prevent this
marriage; and, Master Dick, ye know the way of him&mdash;do
so he will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; returned Dick, with composure, &ldquo;you
and I, my poor brother, are dead men; for I sit here a
prisoner upon suspicion, and my neck was to answer for
this very marriage that he purposeth to mar. I had a fair
choice, by the rood! to lose my sweetheart or else lose my
life! Well, the cast is thrown&mdash;it is to be my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass,&rdquo; cried Lawless, half arising, &ldquo;I am gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick had his hand at once upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend Lawless, sit ye still,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An ye have
eyes, look yonder at the corner by the chancel arch; see ye
not that, even upon the motion of your rising, yon armed
men are up and ready to intercept you? Yield ye, friend.
Ye were bold aboard ship, when ye thought to die a sea-death;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
be bold again, now that y&rsquo; are to die presently upon
the gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Dick,&rdquo; gasped Lawless, &ldquo;the thing hath come
upon me somewhat of the suddenest. But give me a moment
till I fetch my breath again; and, by the mass, I will be as
stout-hearted as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is my bold fellow!&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;And yet,
Lawless, it goes hard against the grain with me to die; but
where whining mendeth nothing, wherefore whine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, that indeed!&rdquo; chimed Lawless. &ldquo;And a fig for
death, at worst! It has to be done, my master, soon or
late. And hanging in a good quarrel is an easy death, they
say, though I could never hear of any that came back to say
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, the stout old rascal leaned back in his
stall, folded his arms, and began to look about him with the
greatest air of insolence and unconcern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for the matter of that,&rdquo; Dick added, &ldquo;it is yet
our best chance to keep quiet. We wot not yet what Duckworth
purposes; and when all is said, and if the worst befall,
we may yet clear our feet of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that they ceased talking, they were aware of a very
distant and thin strain of mirthful music which steadily grew
nearer, louder and merrier. The bells in the tower began to
break forth into a doubling peal, and a greater and greater
concourse of people to crowd into the church, shuffling the
snow from off their feet, and clapping and blowing in their
hands. The western door was flung wide open, showing a
glimpse of sunlit, snowy street, and admitting in a great
gust the shrewd air of the morning; and in short, it became
plain by every sign, that Lord Shoreby desired to be married
very early in the day, and that the wedding-train was
drawing near.</p>

<p>Some of Lord Shoreby&rsquo;s men now cleared a passage down
the middle aisle, forcing the people back with lance-stocks;
and just then, outside the portal, the secular musicians could
be descried drawing near over the frozen snow, the fifers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
trumpeters scarlet in the face with lusty blowing, the
drummers and the cymbalists beating as for a wager.
These as they drew near the door of the sacred building, filed
off on either side, and marking time to their own vigorous
music, stood stamping in the snow. As they thus opened
their ranks, the leaders of this noble bridal train appeared
behind and between them; and such was the variety and
gaiety of their attire, such the display of silks and velvet,
fur and satin, embroidery and lace, that the procession
showed forth upon the snow like a flower-bed in a path or a
painted window in a wall.</p>

<p>First came the bride, a sorry sight, as pale as winter,
clinging to Sir Daniel&rsquo;s arm, and attended, as bridesmaid,
by the short young lady who had befriended Dick the night
before. Close behind, in the most radiant toilet, followed
the bridegroom, halting on a gouty foot, and as he passed
the threshold of the sacred building, and doffed his hat, his
bald head was seen to be rosy with emotion.</p>

<p>And now came the hour of Ellis Duckworth.</p>

<p>Dick, who sat stunned among contrary emotions, grasping
the desk in front of him, beheld a movement in the
crowd, people jostling backward, and eyes and arms uplifted.
Following these signs, he beheld three or four men
with bent bows, leaning from the clerestory gallery. At the
same instant they delivered their discharge, and before the
clamour and cries of the astounded populace had time to
swell fully upon the ear, they had flitted from their perch
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The nave was full of swaying heads and voices screaming;
the ecclesiastics thronged in terror from their places; the
music ceased, and though the bells overhead continued for
some seconds to clang upon the air, some wind of the disaster
seemed to find its way at last even to the chamber where the
ringers were leaping on their ropes, and they also desisted
from their merry labours.</p>

<p>Right in the midst of the nave the bridegroom lay stone-dead,
pierced by two black arrows. The bride had fainted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
Sir Daniel stood, towering above the crowd in his surprise
and anger, a clothyard shaft quivering in his left forearm,
and his face streaming blood from another which had grazed
his brow.</p>

<p>Long before any search could be made for them, the
authors of this tragic interruption had clattered down a
turnpike stair and decamped by a postern door.</p>

<p>But Dick and Lawless still remained in pawn; they had
indeed arisen on the first alarm, and pushed manfully to gain
the door; but what with the narrowness of the stalls, and
the crowding of terrified priests and choristers, the attempt
had been in vain, and they had stoically resumed their places.</p>

<p>And now, pale with horror, Sir Oliver rose to his feet and
called upon Sir Daniel, pointing with one hand to Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is Richard Shelton&mdash;alas the hour!&mdash;blood
guilty! Seize him!&mdash;bid him be seized! For all
our lives&rsquo; sakes, take him and bind him surely! He hath
sworn our fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Daniel was blinded by anger&mdash;blinded by the hot
blood that still streamed across his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Hale him forth! By the
cross of Holywood, but he shall rue this hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd fell back, and a party of archers invaded the
choir, laid rough hands on Dick, dragged him headforemost
from the stall, and thrust him by the shoulders down the
chancel steps. Lawless, on his part, sat as still as a mouse.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel, brushing the blood out of his eyes, stared
blinkingly upon his captive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;treacherous and insolent, I have thee
fast; and by all potent oaths, for every drop of blood that
now trickles in mine eyes I will wring a groan out of thy
carcass. Away with him!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Here is no place!
Off with him to my house.&mdash;I will number every joint of thy
body with a torture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick, putting off his captors, uplifted his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanctuary!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Sanctuary! Ho, there,
my fathers! They would drag me from the church!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;From the church thou hast defiled with murder, boy,&rdquo;
added a tall man, magnificently dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what probation?&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;They do accuse
me, indeed, of some complicity, but have not proved one
tittle. I was, in truth, a suitor for this damsel&rsquo;s hand; and
she, I will be bold to say it, repaid my suit with favour. But
what then? To love a maid is no offence, I trow&mdash;nay, nor
to gain her love. In all else I stand here free from guiltiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approval among the bystanders,
so boldly Dick declared his innocence; but at the same time
a throng of accusers arose upon the other side, crying how
he had been found last night in Sir Daniel&rsquo;s house, how he
wore a sacrilegious disguise; and in the midst of the babel,
Sir Oliver indicated Lawless, both by voice and gesture, as
accomplice to the fact. He, in his turn, was dragged from
his seat and set beside his leader. The feelings of the crowd
rose high on either side, and while some dragged the prisoners
to and fro to favour their escape, others cursed and struck
them with their fists. Dick&rsquo;s ears rang and his brain swam
dizzily, like a man struggling in the eddies of a furious river.</p>

<p>But the tall man, who had already answered Dick, by
a prodigious exercise of voice restored silence and order in
the mob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for arms. We may so judge
of their intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon Dick they found no weapon but his poniard, and
this told in his favour, until one man officiously drew it from
its sheath, and found it still uncleansed of the blood of
Rutter. At this there was a great shout among Sir Daniel&rsquo;s
followers, which the tall man suppressed by a gesture and
an imperious glance. But when it came to the turn of Lawless,
there was found under his gown a sheaf of arrows
identical with those that had been shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How say ye now?&rdquo; asked the tall man, frowningly, of
Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;I am here in sanctuary, is it not
so? Well, sir, I see by your bearing that ye are high in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
station, and I read in your countenance the marks of piety
and justice. To you, then, I will yield me prisoner, and that
blithely, foregoing the advantage of this holy place. But
rather than to be yielded into the discretion of that man&mdash;whom
I do here accuse with a loud voice to be the murderer
of my natural father and the unjust detainer of my lands
and revenues&mdash;rather than that, I would beseech you, under
favour, with your own gentle hand, to despatch me on the
spot. Your own ears have heard him, how before that I was
proven guilty he did threaten me with torments. It
standeth not with your own honour to deliver me to my
sworn enemy and old oppressor, but to try me fairly by the
way of law, and, if that I be guilty indeed, to slay me
mercifully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; cried Sir Daniel, &ldquo;ye will not hearken to this
wolf? His bloody dagger reeks him the lie into his
face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but suffer me, good knight,&rdquo; returned the tall
stranger; &ldquo;your own vehemence doth somewhat tell against
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here the bride, who had come to herself some minutes
past, and looked wildly on upon this scene, broke loose from
those that held her, and fell upon her knees before the last
speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord of Risingham,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;hear me, in justice.
I am here in this man&rsquo;s custody by mere force, reft from
mine own people. Since that day I had never pity, countenance,
nor comfort from the face of man&mdash;but from him only&mdash;Richard
Shelton&mdash;whom they now accuse and labour to
undo. My lord, if he was yesternight in Sir Daniel&rsquo;s mansion,
it was I that brought him there; he came but at my prayer,
and thought to do no hurt. While yet Sir Daniel was a good
lord to him he fought with them of the Black Arrow loyally;
but when his foul guardian sought his life by practices, and
he fled by night, for his soul&rsquo;s sake, out of that bloody house,
whither was he to turn&mdash;he, helpless and penniless? Or if he
be fallen among ill company, whom should ye blame&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
lad that was unjustly handled, or the guardian that did
abuse his trust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the short young lady fell on her knees by
Joanna&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, my good lord and natural uncle,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I can bear testimony, on my conscience and before the
face of all, that what this maiden saith is true. It was I,
unworthy, that did lead the young man in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earl Risingham had heard in silence, and when the
voices ceased he still stood silent for a space. Then he gave
Joanna his hand to arise, though it was to be observed that
he did not offer the like courtesy to her who had called herself
his niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a right intricate affair,
the which, with your good leave, it shall be mine to examine
and adjust. Content ye, then; your business is in careful
hands; justice shall be done you; and in the meanwhile,
get ye incontinently home, and have your hurts attended.
The air is shrewd, and I would not ye took cold upon these
scratches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a sign with his hand; it was passed down the
nave by obsequious servants, who waited there upon his
smallest gesture. Instantly, without the church, a tucket
sounded shrill, and through the open portal archers and men-at-arms,
uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the
badge of Lord Risingham, began to file into the church,
took Dick and Lawless from those who still detained them,
and, closing their files about the prisoners, marched forth
again and disappeared.</p>

<p>As they were passing Joanna held both her hands to
Dick and cried him her farewell; and the bridesmaid, nothing
downcast by her uncle&rsquo;s evident displeasure, blew him
a kiss, with a &ldquo;Keep your heart up, lion-driver!&rdquo; that for
the first time since the accident called up a smile to the faces
of the crowd.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>EARL RISINGHAM</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Earl Risingham</span>, although by far the most important
person then in Shoreby, was poorly lodged in the house of a
private gentleman upon the extreme outskirts of the town.
Nothing but the armed men at the doors, and the mounted
messengers that kept arriving and departing, announced
the temporary residence of a great lord.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, from lack of space, Dick and Lawless
were clapped into the same apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, Master Richard,&rdquo; said the outlaw; &ldquo;it
was excellently well spoken, and, for my part, I thank you
cordially. Here we are in good hands; we shall be justly
tried, and some time this evening decently hanged on the
same tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my poor friend, I do believe it,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet have we a string to our bow,&rdquo; returned Lawless.
&ldquo;Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand; he holdeth
you right near his heart, both for your own and for your
father&rsquo;s sake; and, knowing you guiltless of this fact, he
will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;What can he do? He
hath but a handful. Alack, if it were but to-morrow&mdash;could
I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow&mdash;all
were, I think, otherwise. But now there is
no help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded Lawless, &ldquo;an ye will stand to it for
my innocence, I will stand to it for yours, and that stoutly.
It shall naught avail us; but an I be to hang, it shall not be
for lack of swearing.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span></p>

<p>And then, while Dick gave himself over to his reflections,
the old rogue curled himself down into a corner, pulled his
monkish hood about his face, and composed himself to sleep.
Soon he was loudly snoring, so utterly had his long life of
hardship and adventure blunted the sense of apprehension.</p>

<p>It was long after noon, and the day was already failing,
before the door was opened and Dick taken forth and led
upstairs to where, in a warm cabinet, Earl Risingham sat
musing over the fire.</p>

<p>On his captive&rsquo;s entrance he looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I knew your father, who was a man of
honour, and this inclineth me to be the more lenient; but
I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your
character. Ye do consort with murderers and robbers;
upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the
king&rsquo;s peace; ye are suspected to have piratically seized
upon a ship; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment
in your enemy&rsquo;s house; a man is slain that very
evening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An it like you, my lord,&rdquo; Dick interposed, &ldquo;I will at
once avow my guilt, such as it is. I slew this fellow Rutter;
and to the proof&rdquo;&mdash;searching in his bosom&mdash;&ldquo;here is a
letter from his wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Risingham took the letter, and opened and read it
twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have read this?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read it,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you for York or Lancaster?&rdquo; the earl demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, it was but a little while back that I was asked
that question, and knew not how to answer it,&rdquo; said Dick;
&ldquo;but, having answered once, I will not vary. My lord, I
am for York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earl nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honestly replied,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But wherefore, then,
deliver me this letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but against traitors, my lord, are not all sides
arrayed?&rdquo; cried Dick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would they were, young gentleman,&rdquo; returned the
earl; &ldquo;and I do at least approve your saying. There is
more youth than guile in you, I do perceive; and were not
Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side, I were half tempted
to espouse your quarrel. For I have inquired, and it appears
that you have been hardly dealt with, and have much
excuse. But look ye, sir, I am, before all else, a leader in
the queen&rsquo;s interest; and though by nature a just man, as
I believe, and leaning even to the excess of mercy, yet must
I order my goings for my party&rsquo;s interest, and, to keep Sir
Daniel, I would go far about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; returned Dick, &ldquo;ye will think me very bold
to counsel you: but do ye count upon Sir Daniel&rsquo;s faith?
Methought he had changed sides intolerably often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, it is the way of England. What would ye have?&rdquo;
the earl demanded. &ldquo;But ye are unjust to the knight of
Tunstall; and as faith goes, in this unfaithful generation,
he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster.
Even in our last reverses he stood firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An it please you, then,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;to cast your eye
upon this letter, ye might somewhat change your thought of
him,&rdquo; and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel&rsquo;s letter to Lord
Wensleydale.</p>

<p>The effect upon the earl&rsquo;s countenance was instant; he
lowered like an angry lion, and his hand, with a sudden
movement, clutched at his dagger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have read this also?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;It is your lordship&rsquo;s own estate
he offers to Lord Wensleydale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my own estate, even as ye say!&rdquo; returned the earl.
&ldquo;I am your bedesman for this letter. It hath shown me a
fox&rsquo;s hole. Command me, Master Shelton; I will not be
backward in gratitude, and to begin with, York or Lancaster,
true man or thief, I do now set you at freedom. Go, a-Mary&rsquo;s
name! But judge it right that I retain and hang
your fellow Lawless. The crime hath been most open, and
it were fitting that some open punishment should follow.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, I make it my first suit to you to spare him
also,&rdquo; pleaded Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an old condemned rogue, thief, and vagabond,
Master Shelton,&rdquo; said the earl. &ldquo;He hath been gallows-ripe
this score of years. And, whether for one thing or another,
whether to-morrow or the day after, where is the great
choice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, my lord, it was through love to me that he came
hither,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;and I were churlish and thankless
to desert him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Shelton, ye are troublesome,&rdquo; replied the earl
severely. &ldquo;It is an evil way to prosper in this world.
Howbeit, and to be quit of your importunity, I will once
more humour you. Go then, together; but go warily, and
get swiftly out of Shoreby town. For this Sir Daniel (whom
may the saints confound!) thirsteth most greedily to have
your blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, I do now offer you in words my gratitude,
trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service,&rdquo;
replied Dick, as he turned from the apartment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>ARBLASTER AGAIN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal, by a back
way, out of the house where Lord Risingham held his
garrison, the evening had already come.</p>

<p>They paused in shelter of the garden wall to consult on
their best course. The danger was extreme. If one of Sir
Daniel&rsquo;s men caught sight of them and raised the view-hallo,
they would be run down and butchered instantly. And not
only was the town of Shoreby a mere net of peril for their
lives, but to make for the open country was to run the risk
of the patrols.</p>

<p>A little way off, upon some open ground, they spied a
windmill standing; and, hard by that, a very large granary
with open doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How if we lay there until the night fall?&rdquo; Dick proposed.</p>

<p>And Lawless having no better suggestion to offer, they
made a straight push for the granary at a run, and concealed
themselves behind the door among some straw. The daylight
rapidly departed; and presently the moon was silvering
the frozen snow. Now or never was their opportunity to
gain the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes&rdquo; unobserved and change
their tell-tale garments. Yet even then it was advisable
to go round by the outskirts, and not run the gauntlet of
the market-place, where, in the concourse of people, they
stood the more imminent peril to be recognised and slain.</p>

<p>This course was a long one. It took them not far from
the house by the beach, now lying dark and silent, and
brought them forth at last by the margin of the harbour.
Many of the ships, as they could see by the clear moonshine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
had weighed anchor, and, profiting by the calm sky, proceeded
for more distant parts; answerably to this, the rude
alehouses along the beach (although, in defiance of the
curfew law, they still shone with fire and candle) were no
longer thronged with customers, and no longer echoed to
the chorus of sea-songs.</p>

<p>Hastily, half-running, with their monkish raiment kilted
to the knee, they plunged through the deep snow and
threaded the labyrinth of marine lumber; and they were
already more than half-way round the harbour when, as
they were passing close before an alehouse, the door suddenly
opened and let out a gush of light upon their fleeting figures.</p>

<p>Instantly they stopped, and made believe to be engaged
in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Three men, one after another, came out of the alehouse,
and the last closed the door behind him. All three were
unsteady upon their feet, as if they had passed the day in
deep potations, and they now stood wavering in the moon-light,
like men who knew not what they would be after. The
tallest of the three was talking in a loud, lamentable voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven pieces of as good Gascony as ever a tapster
broached,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the best ship out o&rsquo; the port o&rsquo;
Dartmouth, a Virgin Mary parcel-gilt, thirteen pounds of
good gold money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have bad losses too,&rdquo; interrupted one of the others.
&ldquo;I have had losses of mine own, gossip Arblaster. I was
robbed at Martinmas of five shillings and a leather wallet
well worth ninepence farthing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s heart smote him at what he heard. Until that
moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper
who had been ruined by the loss of the <i>Good Hope</i>; so careless,
in those days, were men who wore arms of the goods and
interests of their inferiors. But this sudden encounter
reminded him sharply of the high-handed manner and ill-ending
of his enterprise; and both he and Lawless turned
their heads the other way, to avoid the chance of recognition.</p>

<p>The ship&rsquo;s dog had, however, made his escape from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
wreck and found his way back again to Shoreby. He was
now at Arblaster&rsquo;s heels, and, suddenly sniffing and pricking
his ears, he darted forward and began to bark furiously at
the two sham friars.</p>

<p>His master unsteadily followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, shipmates!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have ye ever a penny
piece for a poor old shipman, clean destroyed by pirates?
I am a man that would have paid for you both o&rsquo; Thursday
morning; and now here I be o&rsquo; Saturday night, begging for
a flagon of ale! Ask my man Tom, if ye misdoubt me.
Seven pieces of good Gascon wine, a ship that was mine own,
and was my father&rsquo;s before me, a Blessed Mary of plane-tree
wood and parcel-gilt, and thirteen pounds in gold and silver.
Hey! what say ye? A man that fought the French too;
for I have fought the French; I have cut more French
throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out
of Dartmouth. Come, a penny piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word, lest
he should recognise their voices; and they stood there as
helpless as a ship ashore, not knowing where to turn nor
what to hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye dumb, boy?&rdquo; inquired the skipper.&mdash;&ldquo;Mates,&rdquo;
he added, with a hiccup, &ldquo;they be dumb. I like not this
manner of discourtesy; for an a man be dumb, so be as he&rsquo;s
courteous, he will still speak when he was spoken to, methinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the sailor, Tom, who was a man of great
personal strength, seemed to have conceived some suspicion
of these two speechless figures; and, being soberer than his
captain, stepped suddenly before him, took Lawless roughly
by the shoulder, and asked him, with an oath, what ailed
him that he held his tongue. To this the outlaw, thinking
all was over, made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched
the sailor on the sand, and, calling upon Dick to follow him,
took to his heels among the lumber.</p>

<p>The affair passed in a second. Before Dick could run at
all, Arblaster had him in his arms; Tom, crawling on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
face, had caught him by one foot, and the third man had a
drawn cutlass brandishing above his head.</p>

<p>It was not so much the danger, it was not so much the
annoyance that now bowed down the spirits of young
Shelton; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped
Sir Daniel, convinced Lord Risingham, and now fall helpless
into the hands of this old drunken sailor; and not merely
helpless, but, as his conscience loudly told him when it was
too late, actually guilty&mdash;actually the bankrupt debtor of
the man whose ship he had stolen and lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me him back into the alehouse, till I see his face,&rdquo;
said Arblaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; returned Tom; &ldquo;but let us first unload
his wallet, lest the other lads cry share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But though he was searched from head to foot not a
penny was found upon him; nothing but Lord Foxham&rsquo;s
signet, which they plucked savagely from his finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn me him to the moon,&rdquo; said the skipper; and
taking Dick by the chin, he cruelly jerked his head into the
air. &ldquo;Blessed Virgin!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is the pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Virgin of Bordeaux, it is the man himself!&rdquo;
repeated Arblaster.&mdash;&ldquo;What, sea-thief, do I hold you?&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Where is my ship? Where is my wine? Hey!
have I you in my hands?&mdash;Tom, give me one end of a cord
here; I will so truss me this sea-thief, hand and foot together,
like a basting turkey&mdash;marry, I will so bind him up&mdash;and
thereafter I will so beat&mdash;so beat him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he ran on, winding the cord meanwhile about
Dick&rsquo;s limbs with the dexterity peculiar to seamen, and at
every turn and cross securing it with a knot, and tightening
the whole fabric with a savage pull.</p>

<p>When he had done, the lad was a mere package in his
hands&mdash;as helpless as the dead. The skipper held him at
arm&rsquo;s-length, and laughed aloud. Then he fetched him a
stunning buffet on the ear; and then turned him about, and
furiously kicked and kicked him. Anger rose up in Dick&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
bosom like a storm; anger strangled him, and he thought
to have died; but when the sailor, tired of this cruel play,
dropped him all his length upon the sand and turned to
consult with his companions, he instantly regained command
of his temper. Here was a momentary respite; ere they
began again to torture him, he might have found some
method to escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure.</p>

<p>Presently, sure enough, and while his captors were still
discussing what to do with him, he took heart of grace, and,
with a pretty steady voice, addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My masters,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;are ye gone clean foolish?
Here hath Heaven put into your hands as pretty an occasion
to grow rich as ever shipman had&mdash;such as ye might make
thirty over-sea adventures and not find again&mdash;and, by the
mass! what do ye? Beat me?&mdash;nay; so would an angry
child! But for long-headed tarry-Johns, that fear not fire
nor water, and that love gold as they love beef, methinks
ye are not wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;now y&rsquo; are trussed ye would cozen us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cozen you!&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;Nay, if ye be fools, it
would be easy. But if ye be shrewd fellows, as I trow ye
are, ye can see plainly where your interest lies. When I
took your ship from you, we were many, we were well clad
and armed; but now, bethink you a little, who mustered
that array? One incontestably that hath made much gold.
And if he, being already rich, continueth to hunt after more
even in the face of storms&mdash;bethink you once more&mdash;shall
there not be a treasure somewhere hidden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What meaneth he?&rdquo; asked one of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of
vinegary wine,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;forget them, for the trash
they are; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the
name, that shall, in twelve hours, make or mar you for ever.
But take me up from where I lie, and let us go somewhere
near at hand and talk across a flagon, for I am sore and
frozen, and my mouth is half among the snow.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He seeks but to cozen us,&rdquo; said Tom contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cozen! cozen!&rdquo; cried the third man. &ldquo;I would I
could see the man that could cozen me! He were a cozener
indeed! Nay, I was not born yesterday. I can see a
church when it hath a steeple on it; and for my part, gossip
Arblaster, methinks there is some sense in this young man.
Shall we go hear him, indeed? Say, shall we go hear him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale, good
Master Pirret,&rdquo; returned Arblaster.&mdash;&ldquo;How say ye, Tom?
But then the wallet is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pay,&rdquo; said the other&mdash;&ldquo;I will pay. I would fain
see this matter out; I do believe, upon my conscience, there
is gold in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, if ye get again to drinking, all is lost!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gossip Arblaster, ye suffer your fellow to have too
much liberty,&rdquo; returned Master Pirret. &ldquo;Would ye be led
by a hired man? Fy, fy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, fellow!&rdquo; said Arblaster, addressing Tom.
&ldquo;Will ye put your oar in? Truly a fine pass, when the crew
is to correct the skipper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, go your way,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;I wash my
hands of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set him, then, upon his feet,&rdquo; said Master Pirret. &ldquo;I
know a privy place where we may drink and discourse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am to walk, my friends, ye must set my feet at
liberty,&rdquo; said Dick, when he had been once more planted
upright like a post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He saith true,&rdquo; laughed Pirret. &ldquo;Truly, he could not
walk accoutred as he is. Give it a slit&mdash;out with your knife
and slit it, gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Arblaster paused at this proposal; but as his companion
continued to insist, and Dick had the sense to keep
the merest wooden indifference of expression, and only
shrugged his shoulders over the delay, the skipper consented
at last, and cut the cords which tied his prisoner&rsquo;s feet and
legs. Not only did this enable Dick to walk; but, the whole
network of his bonds being proportionately loosened, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely, and
could hope, with time and trouble, to entirely disengage it.
So much he owed already to the owlish silliness and greed of
Master Pirret.</p>

<p>That worthy now assumed the lead, and conducted them
to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless had taken
Arblaster on the day of the gale. It was now quite deserted;
the fire was a pile of red embers, radiating the most ardent
heat; and when they had chosen their places, and the landlord
had set before them a measure of mulled ale, both Pirret
and Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their
elbows like men bent upon a pleasant hour.</p>

<p>The table at which they sat, like all the others in the
alehouse, consisted of a heavy, square board, set on a pair
of barrels; and each of the four curiously assorted cronies
sat at one side of the square, Pirret facing Arblaster, and
Dick opposite to the common sailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, young man,&rdquo; said Pirret, &ldquo;to your tale.
It doth appear, indeed, that ye have somewhat abused our
gossip Arblaster; but what then? Make it up to him&mdash;show
him but this chance to become wealthy&mdash;and I will go
pledge he will forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random; but it
was now necessary, under the supervision of six eyes, to
invent and tell some marvellous story, and, if it were possible,
get back into his hands the all-important signet. To squander
time was the first necessity. The longer his stay lasted,
the more would his captors drink, and the surer should he
be when he attempted his escape.</p>

<p>Well, Dick was not much of an inventor, and what he told
was pretty much the tale of Ali Baba, with Shoreby and Tunstall
Forest substituted for the East, and the treasures of the
cavern rather exaggerated than diminished. As the reader
is aware, it is an excellent story, and has but one drawback&mdash;that
it is not true; and so, as these three simple shipmen
now heard it for the first time, their eyes stood out of their
faces, and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger&rsquo;s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span></p>

<p>Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called
for; and while Dick was still artfully spinning out the
incidents a third followed the second.</p>

<p>Here was the position of the parties towards the end:</p>

<p>Arblaster, three-parts drunk and one-half asleep, hung
helpless on his stool. Even Tom had been much delighted
with the tale, and his vigilance had abated in proportion.
Meanwhile Dick had gradually wormed his right arm clear
of its bonds, and was ready to risk all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Pirret, &ldquo;y&rsquo; are one of these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was made so,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;against my will; but
an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share, I
should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave,
and standing shot and buffet like a soldier. Here be we
four; good! Let us, then, go forth into the forest to-morrow
ere the sun be up. Could we come honestly by a
donkey, it were better; but an we cannot, we have our four
strong backs, and I warrant me we shall come home
staggering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirret licked his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this magic,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;this password, whereby
the cave is opened&mdash;how call ye it, friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, none know the word but the three chiefs,&rdquo; returned
Dick; &ldquo;but here is your great good fortune, that,
on this very evening, I should be the bearer of a spell to
open it. It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the
captain&rsquo;s wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A spell!&rdquo; said Arblaster, half awakening, and squinting
upon Dick with one eye. &ldquo;Aroint thee! no spells! I
be a good Christian. Ask my man, Tom, else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but this is white magic,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;It doth
naught with the devil; only the powers of numbers, herbs,
and planets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Pirret; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis but white magic, gossip.
There is no sin therein, I do assure you. But proceed,
good youth. This spell&mdash;in what should it consist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, that I will incontinently show you,&rdquo; answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
Dick. &ldquo;Have ye there the ring ye took from my finger?
Good! Now hold it forth before you by the extreme finger-ends,
at the arm&rsquo;s length, and over against the shining of
these embers. &rsquo;Tis so exactly. Thus, then, is the spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a haggard glance, Dick saw the coast was clear
between him and the door. He put up an internal prayer.
Then, whipping forth his arm, he made but one snatch of
the ring, and at the same instant, levering up the table, he
sent it bodily over upon the seaman Tom. He, poor soul,
went down bawling under the ruins; and before Arblaster
understood that anything was wrong, or Pirret could collect
his dazzled wits, Dick had run to the door and escaped into
the moonlit night.</p>

<p>The moon, which now rode in the mid-heavens, and the
extreme whiteness of the snow, made the open ground about
the harbour bright as day; and young Shelton leaping,
with kilted robe, among the lumber, was a conspicuous
figure from afar.</p>

<p>Tom and Pirret followed him with shouts; from every
drinking-shop they were joined by others whom their cries
aroused; and presently a whole fleet of sailors was in full pursuit.
But Jack ashore was a bad runner, even in the fifteenth
century, and Dick, besides, had a start, which he rapidly
improved, until, as he drew near the entrance of a narrow
lane, he even paused and looked laughingly behind him.</p>

<p>Upon the white floor of snow all the shipmen of Shoreby
came clustering in an inky mass, and tailing out rearward
in isolated clumps. Every man was shouting or screaming;
every man was gesticulating with both arms in air; some
one was continually falling; and to complete the picture,
when one fell, a dozen would fall upon the top of him.</p>

<p>The confused mass of sound which they rolled up as
high as to the moon was partly comical and partly terrifying
to the fugitive whom they were hunting. In itself, it
was impotent, for he made sure no seaman in the port could
run him down. But the mere volume of noise, in so far as it
must awake all the sleepers in Shoreby, and bring all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
skulking sentries to the street, did really threaten him with
danger in the front. So, spying a dark doorway at a
corner, he whipped briskly into it, and let the uncouth hunt
go by him, still shouting and gesticulating, and all red with
hurry, and white with tumbles in the snow.</p>

<p>It was a long while, indeed, before this great invasion of
the town by the harbour came to an end, and it was long
before silence was restored. For long, lost sailors were still
to be heard pounding and shouting through the streets in
all directions and in every quarter of the town. Quarrels
followed, sometimes among themselves, sometimes with the
men of the patrols; knives were drawn, blows given and
received, and more than one dead body remained behind
upon the snow.</p>

<p>When, a full hour later, the last seaman returned
grumblingly to the harbour side and his particular tavern,
it may fairly be questioned if he had ever known what
manner of man he was pursuing, but it was absolutely sure
that he had now forgotten. By next morning there were
many strange stories flying; and a little while after, the
legend of the devil&rsquo;s nocturnal visit was an article of faith
with all the lads of Shoreby.</p>

<p>But the return of the last seaman did not, even yet, set
free young Shelton from his cold imprisonment in the doorway.</p>

<p>For some time after, there was a great activity of
patrols; and special parties came forth to make the round
of the place and report to one or other of the great lords,
whose slumbers had been thus unusually broken.</p>

<p>The night was already well spent before Dick ventured
from his hiding-place, and came, safe and sound, but aching
with cold and bruises, to the door of the &ldquo;Goat and Bagpipes.&rdquo;
As the law required, there was neither fire nor
candle in the house; but he groped his way into a corner of
the icy guest-room, found an end of a blanket, which he
hitched around his shoulders, and creeping close to the
nearest sleeper, was soon lost in slumber.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>THE SHRILL TRUMPET</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Very</span> early the next morning, before the first peep of the
day, Dick arose, changed his garments, armed himself once
more like a gentleman, and set forth for Lawless&rsquo;s den in
the forest. There, it will be remembered, he had left Lord
Foxham&rsquo;s papers; and to get these and be back in time
for the tryst with the young Duke of Gloucester could only
be managed by an early start, and the most vigorous
walking.</p>

<p>The frost was more rigorous than ever; the air windless
and dry, and stinging to the nostril. The moon had gone
down, but the stars were still bright and numerous, and the
reflection from the snow was clear and cheerful. There
was no need for a lamp to walk by; nor, in that still but
ringing air, the least temptation to delay.</p>

<p>Dick had crossed the greater part of the open ground
between Shoreby and the forest, and had reached the
bottom of the little hill, some hundred yards below the
Cross of St. Bride, when, through the stillness of the black
morn, there rang forth the note of a trumpet, so shrill, clear,
and piercing, that he thought he had never heard the match
of it for audibility. It was blown once, and then hurriedly
a second time; and then the clash of steel succeeded.</p>

<p>At this young Shelton pricked his ears, and drawing
his sword, ran forward up the hill.</p>

<p>Presently he came in sight of the cross, and was aware
of a most fierce encounter raging on the road before it.
There were seven or eight assailants, and but one to keep
head against them; but so active and dexterous was this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
one, so desperately did he charge and scatter his opponents,
so deftly keep his footing on the ice, that already, before
Dick could intervene, he had slain one, wounded another,
and kept the whole in check.</p>

<p>Still, it was by a miracle that he continued his defence,
and at any moment, any accident, the least slip of foot or
error of hand, his life would be a forfeit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold ye well, sir! Here is help!&rdquo; cried Richard;
and forgetting that he was alone, and that the cry was somewhat
irregular, &ldquo;To the Arrow! to the Arrow!&rdquo; he shouted,
as he fell upon the rear of the assailants.</p>

<p>These were stout fellows also, for they gave not an inch
at this surprise, but faced about, and fell with astonishing
fury upon Dick. Four against one, the steel flashed about
him in the starlight; the sparks flew fiercely; one of the
men opposed to him fell&mdash;in the stir of the fight he hardly
knew why; then he himself was struck across the head,
and though the steel cap below his hood protected him, the
blow beat him down upon one knee, with a brain whirling
like a windmill-sail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man whom he had come to rescue, instead
of joining in the conflict, had, on the first sign of intervention,
leaped aback and blown again, and yet more
urgently and loudly, on that same shrill-voiced trumpet
that began the alarm. Next moment, indeed, his foes were
on him, and he was once more charging and fleeing, leaping,
stabbing, dropping to his knee, and using indifferently
sword and dagger, foot and hand, with the same unshaken
courage and feverish energy and speed.</p>

<p>But that ear-piercing summons had been heard at last.
There was a muffled rushing in the snow; and in a good hour
for Dick, who saw the sword-points glitter already at his
throat, there poured forth out of the wood upon both sides a
disorderly torrent of mounted men-at-arms, each cased in
iron, and with visor lowered, each bearing his lance in rest,
or his sword bared and raised, and each carrying, so to
speak, a passenger, in the shape of an archer or page, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
leaped one after another from their perches, and had presently
doubled the array.</p>

<p>The original assailants, seeing themselves outnumbered
and surrounded, threw down their arms without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize me these fellows!&rdquo; said the hero of the trumpet;
and when his order had been obeyed, he drew near to Dick
and looked him in the face.</p>

<p>Dick, returning this scrutiny, was surprised to find in one
who had displayed such strength, skill, and energy, a lad no
older than himself&mdash;slightly deformed, with one shoulder
higher than the other, and of a pale, painful, and distorted
countenance.<a name="FnAnchor_2" id="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The eyes, however, were very clear and
bold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said this lad, &ldquo;ye came in good time for me, and
none too early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; returned Dick, with a faint sense that he was
in the presence of a great personage, &ldquo;ye are yourself so
marvellous a good swordsman that I believe ye had managed
them single-handed. Howbeit, it was certainly well for me
that your men delayed no longer than they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How knew ye who I was?&rdquo; demanded the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even now, my lord,&rdquo; Dick answered, &ldquo;I am ignorant
of whom I speak with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;And yet ye threw yourself
head first into this unequal battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw one man valiantly contending against many,&rdquo;
replied Dick, &ldquo;and I had thought myself dishonoured not
to bear him aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A singular sneer played about the young nobleman&rsquo;s
mouth as he made answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are very brave words. But to the more essential&mdash;are
ye Lancaster or York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, I make no secret; I am clear for York,&rdquo; Dick
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass!&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;it is well for you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span></p>

<p>And so saying, he turned towards one of his followers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he continued, in the same sneering and
cruel tones&mdash;&ldquo;let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen.
Truss me them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were but five survivors of the attacking party.
Archers seized them by the arms; they were hurried to the
borders of the wood, and each placed below a tree of suitable
dimensions; the rope was adjusted; an archer, carrying the
end of it, hastily clambered overhead, and before a minute
was over, and without a word passing upon either hand, the
five men were swinging by the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried the deformed leader, &ldquo;back to your
posts, and when I summon you next, be readier to attend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke,&rdquo; said one man, &ldquo;beseech you, tarry not
here alone. Keep but a handful of lances at your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;I have forborne to chide you
for your slowness. Cross me not, therefore. I trust my
hand and arm, for all that I be crooked. Ye were backward
when the trumpet sounded: and ye are now too forward
with your counsels. But it is ever so; last with the lance
and first with the tongue. Let it be reversed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a gesture that was not without a sort of
dangerous nobility, he waved them off.</p>

<p>The footmen climbed again to their seats behind the men-at-arms,
and the whole party moved slowly away and disappeared
in twenty different directions, under the cover of
the forest.</p>

<p>The day was by this time beginning to break, and the
stars to fade. The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon
the countenances of the two young men, who now turned
once more to face each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;ye have seen my vengeance,
which is, like my blade, both sharp and ready. But I
would not have you, for all Christendom, suppose me thankless.
You that came to my aid with a good sword and a
better courage&mdash;unless that ye recoil from my mis-shapeness&mdash;come
to my heart.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span></p>

<p>And so saying, the young leader held out his arms for
an embrace.</p>

<p>In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a
great terror and some hatred for the man whom he had
rescued; but the invitation was so worded that it would
not have been merely discourteous, but cruel, to refuse or
hesitate, and he hastened to comply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my lord duke,&rdquo; he said, when he had regained
his freedom, &ldquo;do I suppose aright? Are ye my Lord
Duke of Gloucester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Richard of Gloucester,&rdquo; returned the other.
&ldquo;And you&mdash;how call they you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick told him his name, and presented Lord Foxham&rsquo;s
signet, which the duke immediately recognised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye come too soon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but why should I complain?
Ye are like me, that was here at watch two hours
before the day. But this is the first sally of mine arms;
upon this adventure, Master Shelton, shall I make or mar
the quality of my renown. There lie mine enemies, under
two old, skilled captains, Risingham and Brackley, well
posted for strength, I do believe, but yet upon two sides
without retreat, enclosed betwixt the sea, the harbour, and
the river. Methinks, Shelton, here were a great blow to be
stricken, an we could strike it silently and suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do think so, indeed,&rdquo; cried Dick, warming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye my Lord Foxham&rsquo;s notes?&rdquo; inquired the
duke.</p>

<p>And then Dick, having explained how he was without
them for the moment, made himself bold to offer information
every jot as good, of his own knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for mine own part, my lord duke,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;an
ye had men enough, I would fall on even at this present.
For, look ye, at the peep of day the watches of the night
are over; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward&mdash;only
scour the outskirts with horsemen. Now, then, when
the night-watch is already unarmed, and the rest are at
their morning cup&mdash;now were the time to break them.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How many do ye count?&rdquo; asked Gloucester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They number not two thousand,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seven hundred in the woods behind us,&rdquo; said
the duke; &ldquo;seven hundred follow from Kettley, and will be
here anon; behind these, and farther, are four hundred
more; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day
from here, at Holywood. Shall we attend their coming or
fall on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;when ye hanged these five poor
rogues ye did decide the question. Churls although they
were, in these uneasy times they will be lacked and looked
for, and the alarm be given. Therefore, my lord, if ye
do count upon the advantage of a surprise, ye have not, in
my poor opinion, one whole hour in front of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do think so indeed,&rdquo; returned Crookback. &ldquo;Well,
before an hour ye shall be in the thick on&rsquo;t, winning spurs.
A swift man to Holywood, carrying Lord Foxham&rsquo;s signet;
another along the road to speed my laggards! Nay,
Shelton, by the rood, it may be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lips and
blew.</p>

<p>This time he was not long kept waiting. In a moment
the open space about the cross was filled with horse and
foot. Richard of Gloucester took his place upon the steps,
and despatched messenger after messenger to hasten the
concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hidden in
the immediate neighbourhood among the woods; and before
a quarter of an hour had passed, all his dispositions being
taken, he put himself at their head, and began to move down
the hill towards Shoreby.</p>

<p>His plan was simple. He was to seize a quarter of the
town of Shoreby lying on the right hand of the high-road,
and make his position good there in the narrow lanes until
his reinforcements followed.</p>

<p>If Lord Risingham chose to retreat, Richard would
follow upon his rear, and take him between two fires; or,
if he preferred to hold the town, he would be shut in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
trap, there to be gradually overwhelmed by force of
numbers.</p>

<p>There was but one danger, but that was imminent and
great&mdash;Gloucester&rsquo;s seven hundred might be rolled up and
cut to pieces in the first encounter, and, to avoid this, it was
needful to make the surprise of their arrival as complete as
possible.</p>

<p>The footmen, therefore, were all once more taken up
behind the riders, and Dick had the signal honour meted out
to him of mounting behind Gloucester himself. For as far
as there was any cover the troops moved slowly, and when
they came near the end of the trees that lined the highway,
stopped to breathe and reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The sun was now well up, shining with a frosty brightness
out of a yellow halo, and right over against the luminary,
Shoreby, a field of snowy roofs and ruddy gables, was
rolling up its columns of morning smoke.</p>

<p>Gloucester turned round to Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that poor place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where people are cooking
breakfast, either you shall gain your spurs and I begin a
life of mighty honour and glory in the world&rsquo;s eye, or both
of us, as I conceive it, shall fall dead and be unheard of.
Two Richards are we. Well then, Richard Shelton, they
shall be heard about, these two! Their swords shall not
ring more loudly on men&rsquo;s helmets than their names shall
ring in people&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was astonished at so great a hunger after fame,
expressed with so great vehemence of voice and language;
and he answered very sensibly and quietly, that, for his part,
he promised he would do his duty, and doubted not of
victory if every one did the like.</p>

<p>By this time the horses were well breathed, and the
leader holding up his sword and giving rein, the whole troop
of chargers broke into the gallop and thundered, with their
double load of fighting men, down the remainder of the hill
and across the snow-covered plain that still divided them
from Shoreby.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> whole distance to be crossed was not above a quarter
of a mile. But they had no sooner debouched beyond the
cover of the trees than they were aware of people fleeing and
screaming in the snowy meadows upon either hand. Almost
at the same moment a great rumour began to arise, and
spread and grow continually louder in the town; and they
were not yet half-way to the nearest house before the bells
began to ring backward from the steeple.</p>

<p>The young duke ground his teeth together. By these
so early signals of alarm he feared to find his enemies prepared;
and if he failed to gain a footing in the town, he
knew that his small party would soon be broken and exterminated
in the open.</p>

<p>In the town, however, the Lancastrians were far from
being in so good a posture. It was as Dick had said. The
night-guard had already doffed their harness; the rest were
still hanging&mdash;unlatched, unbraced, all unprepared for
battle&mdash;about their quarters; and in the whole of Shoreby
there were not, perhaps, fifty men full armed, or fifty chargers
to be mounted.</p>

<p>The beating of the bells, the terrifying summons of men
who ran about the streets crying and beating upon the doors,
aroused in an incredibly short space at least two score out
of that half hundred. These got speedily to horse, and, the
alarm still flying wild and contrary, galloped in different
directions.</p>

<p>Thus it befell that, when Richard of Gloucester reached
the first house of Shoreby, he was met in the mouth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
street by a mere handful of lances, whom he swept before his
onset as the storm chases the bark.</p>

<p>A hundred paces into the town, Dick Shelton touched
the duke&rsquo;s arm; the duke, in answer, gathered his reins,
put the shrill trumpet to his mouth, and blowing a concerted
point, turned to the right hand out of the direct advance.
Swerving like a single rider, his whole command turned after
him, and, still at the full gallop of the chargers, swept up
the narrow by-street. Only the last score of riders drew
rein and faced about in the entrance; the footmen, whom
they carried behind them, leapt at the same instant to the
earth, and began, some to bend their bows, and others to
break into and secure the houses upon either hand.</p>

<p>Surprised at this sudden change of direction, and
daunted by the firm front of the rear-guard, the few Lancastrians,
after a momentary consultation, turned and rode
farther into town to seek for reinforcements.</p>

<p>The quarter of the town upon which, by the advice of
Dick, Richard of Gloucester had now seized, consisted of
five small streets of poor and ill-inhabited houses, occupying
a very gentle eminence, and lying open towards the back.</p>

<p>The five streets being each secured by a good guard, the
reserve would thus occupy the centre, out of shot, and yet
ready to carry aid wherever it was needed.</p>

<p>Such was the poorness of the neighbourhood that none
of the Lancastrian lords, and but few of their retainers, had
been lodged therein; and the inhabitants, with one accord,
deserted their houses and fled, squalling, along the streets
or over garden walls.</p>

<p>In the centre, where the five ways all met, a somewhat
ill-favoured alehouse displayed the sign of the &ldquo;Chequers&rdquo;;
and here the Duke of Gloucester chose his headquarters for
the day.</p>

<p>To Dick he assigned the guard of one of the five streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;win your spurs. Win glory for me;
one Richard for another. I tell you, if I rise, ye shall rise by
the same ladder. Go,&rdquo; he added, shaking him by the hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span></p>

<p>But, as soon as Dick was gone, he turned to a little
shabby archer at his elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, Dutton, and that right speedily,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Follow that lad. If ye find him faithful, ye answer for his
safety, a head for a head. Woe unto you if ye return without
him! But if he be faithless&mdash;or, for one instant, ye
misdoubt him&mdash;stab him from behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Dick hastened to secure his post. The
street he had to guard was very narrow, and closely lined
with houses, which projected and overhung the roadway;
but narrow and dark as it was, since it opened upon the
market-place of the town, the main issue of the battle would
probably fall to be decided on that spot.</p>

<p>The market-place was full of townspeople fleeing in
disorder; but there was as yet no sign of any foeman ready
to attack, and Dick judged he had some time before him to
make ready his defence.</p>

<p>The two houses at the end stood deserted, with open
doors, as the inhabitants had left them in their flight, and
from these he had the furniture hastily tossed forth and
piled into a barrier in the entry of the lane. A hundred
men were placed at his disposal, and of these he threw the
more part in the houses, where they might lie in shelter and
deliver their arrows from the windows. With the rest,
under his own immediate eye, he lined the barricade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the utmost uproar and confusion had continued
to prevail throughout the town; and what with the
hurried clashing of bells, the sounding of trumpets, the
swift movement of bodies of horse, the cries of the commanders,
and the shrieks of women, the noise was almost
deafening to the ear. Presently, little by little, the tumult
began to subside; and soon after, files of men in armour
and bodies of archers began to assemble and form in line
of battle in the market-place.</p>

<p>A large portion of this body were in murrey and blue,
and in the mounted knight who ordered their array Dick
recognised Sir Daniel Brackley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span></p>

<p>Then there befell a long pause, which was followed by
the almost simultaneous sounding of four trumpets from
four different quarters of the town. A fifth rang in answer
from the market-place, and at the same moment the files
began to move, and a shower of arrows rattled about the
barricade, and sounded like blows upon the walls of the two
flanking houses.</p>

<p>The attack had begun, by a common signal, on all the
five issues of the quarter. Gloucester was beleaguered upon
every side; and Dick judged, if he would make good his post,
he must rely entirely on the hundred men of his command.</p>

<p>Seven volleys of arrows followed one upon the other, and
in the very thick of the discharges Dick was touched from
behind upon the arm, and found a page holding out to him a
leathern jack, strengthened with bright plates of mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is from my Lord of Gloucester,&rdquo; said the page.
&ldquo;He hath observed, Sir Richard, that ye went unarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick, with a glow at his heart at being so addressed, got
to his feet and, with the assistance of the page, donned the
defensive coat. Even as he did so, two arrows rattled
harmlessly upon the plates, and a third struck down the
page, mortally wounded, at his feet.</p>

<p>Meantime the whole body of the enemy had been
steadily drawing nearer across the market-place; and by
this time were so close at hand that Dick gave the order to
return their shot. Immediately, from behind the barrier
and from the windows of the houses, a counterblast of
arrows sped, carrying death. But the Lancastrians, as if
they had but waited for a signal, shouted loudly in answer;
and began to close at a run upon the barrier, the horsemen
still hanging back, with visors lowered.</p>

<p>Then followed an obstinate and deadly struggle, hand
to hand. The assailants, wielding their falchions with one
hand, strove with the other to drag down the structure of
the barricade. On the other side, the parts were reversed;
and the defenders exposed themselves like madmen to protect
their rampart. So for some minutes the contest raged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
almost in silence, friend and foe falling one upon another.
But it is always the easier to destroy; and when a single
note upon the tucket recalled the attacking party from this
desperate service, much of the barricade had been removed
piecemeal, and the whole fabric had sunk to half its height,
and tottered to a general fall.</p>

<p>And now the footmen in the market-place fell back, at a
run, on every side. The horsemen, who had been standing
in a line two deep, wheeled suddenly, and made their flank
into their front; and as swift as a striking adder, the long,
steel-clad column was launched upon the ruinous barricade.</p>

<p>Of the first two horsemen, one fell, rider and steed, and
was ridden down by his companions. The second leaped
clean upon the summit of the rampart, transpiercing an
archer with his lance. Almost in the same instant he was
dragged from the saddle and his horse despatched.</p>

<p>And then the full weight and impetus of the charge
burst upon and scattered the defenders. The men-at-arms,
surmounting their fallen comrades, and carried onward
by the fury of their onslaught, dashed through Dick&rsquo;s
broken line and poured thundering up the lane beyond, as a
stream bestrides and pours across a broken dam.</p>

<p>Yet was the fight not over. Still, in the narrow jaws
of the entrance, Dick and a few survivors plied their bills
like woodmen; and already, across the width of the passage,
there had been formed a second, a higher, and a more
effectual rampart of fallen men and disembowelled horses,
lashing in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>Baffled by this fresh obstacle, the remainder of the
cavalry fell back; and as, at the sight of this movement, the
flight of arrows redoubled from the casements of the houses,
their retreat had, for a moment, almost degenerated into
flight.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time, those who had crossed the
barricade and charged farther up the street, being met before
the door of the &ldquo;Chequers&rdquo; by the formidable hunchback
and the whole reserve of the Yorkists, began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
come scattering backward, in the excess of disarray and
terror.</p>

<p>Dick and his fellows faced about, fresh men poured out
of the houses; a cruel blast of arrows met the fugitives full
in the face, while Gloucester was already riding down their
rear; in the inside of a minute and a half there was no living
Lancastrian in the street.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did Dick hold up his reeking
blade and give the word to cheer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gloucester dismounted from his horse and
came forward to inspect the post. His face was as pale as
linen; but his eyes shone in his head like some strange jewel,
and his voice, when he spoke, was hoarse and broken with
the exultation of battle and success. He looked at the rampart,
which neither friend nor foe could now approach without
precaution, so fiercely did the horses struggle in the
throes of death, and at the sight of that great carnage he
smiled upon one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despatch these horses,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they keep you from
your vantage.&mdash;Richard Shelton,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;ye have
pleased me. Kneel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lancastrians had already resumed their archery,
and the shafts fell thick in the mouth of the street; but the
duke, minding them not at all, deliberately drew his sword
and dubbed Richard a knight upon the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Sir Richard,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if that ye see
Lord Risingham send me an express upon the instant.
Were it your last man, let me hear of it incontinently. I
had rather venture the post than lose my stroke at him.
For mark me, all of ye,&rdquo; he added, raising his voice, &ldquo;if
Earl Risingham fall by another hand than mine, I shall
count this victory a defeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke,&rdquo; said one of his attendants, &ldquo;is your
grace not weary of exposing his dear life unneedfully? Why
tarry we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catesby,&rdquo; returned the duke, &ldquo;here is the battle, not
elsewhere. The rest are but feigned onslaughts. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
must we vanquish. And for the exposure&mdash;if ye were an
ugly hunchback, and the children gecked at you upon the
street, ye would count your body cheaper, and an hour of
glory worth a life. Howbeit, if ye will, let us ride on and
visit the other posts. Sir Richard here, my namesake, he
shall still hold this entry, where he wadeth to the ankles in
hot blood. Him can we trust. But mark it, Sir Richard,
ye are not yet done. The worst is yet to ward. Sleep not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came right up to young Shelton, looking him hard
in the eyes, and taking his hand in both of his, gave it so
extreme a squeeze that the blood had nearly spurted. Dick
quailed before his eyes. The insane excitement, the
courage, and the cruelty that he read therein, filled him
with dismay about the future. This young duke&rsquo;s was indeed
a gallant spirit, to ride foremost in the ranks of war;
but, after the battle, in the days of peace and in the circle
of his trusted friends, that mind, it was to be dreaded,
would continue to bring forth the fruits of death.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY (<i>concluded</i>)</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Dick</span>, once more left to his own counsels, began to look
about him. The arrow-shot had somewhat slackened. On
all sides the enemy were falling back; and the greater part
of the market-place was now left empty, the snow here
trampled into orange mud, there splashed with gore,
scattered all over with dead men and horses, and bristling
thick with feathered arrows.</p>

<p>On his own side the loss had been cruel. The jaws of
the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped
with the dead and dying; and out of the hundred men with
whom he had begun the battle, there were not seventy left
who could still stand to arms.</p>

<p>At the same time the day was passing. The first reinforcements
might be looked for to arrive at any moment;
and the Lancastrians, already shaken by the result of their
desperate but unsuccessful onslaught, were in an ill temper
to support a fresh invader.</p>

<p>There was a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking
houses; and this, in the frosty, winter sunshine, indicated
ten of the forenoon.</p>

<p>Dick turned to the man who was at his elbow, a little
insignificant archer, binding a cut in his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was well fought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, by my sooth, they
will not charge us twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the little archer, &ldquo;ye have fought right well
for York, and better for yourself. Never hath man in so
brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke&rsquo;s affections.
That he should have entrusted such a post to one he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
knew not is a marvel. But look to your head, Sir Richard!
If ye be vanquished&mdash;ay, if ye give way one foot&rsquo;s-breadth&mdash;axe
or cord shall punish it; and I am set, if ye do aught
doubtful, I will tell you honestly, here to stab you from
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick looked at the little man in amaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And from behind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is right so,&rdquo; returned the archer; &ldquo;and because I
like not the affair I tell it you. Ye must make the post
good, Sir Richard, at your peril. O, our Crookback is a
bold blade and a good warrior; but whether in cold blood
or in hot, he will have all things done exact to his commandment.
If any fail or hinder, they shall die the death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, by the saints!&rdquo; cried Richard, &ldquo;is this so? And
will men follow such a leader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, they follow him gleefully,&rdquo; replied the other;
&ldquo;for if he be exact to punish, he is most open-handed to
reward. And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others,
he is ever liberal of his own, still in the first front of battle,
still the last to sleep. He will go far, will Crookback Dick
o&rsquo; Gloucester!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young knight, if he had before been brave and
vigilant, was now all the more inclined to watchfulness and
courage. His sudden favour, he began to perceive, had
brought perils in its train. And he turned from the archer,
and once more scanned anxiously the market-place. It lay
empty as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like not this quietude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Doubtless they
prepare us some surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as if in answer to his remark, the archers began
once more to advance against the barricade, and the arrows
to fall thick. But there was something hesitating in the
attack. They came not on roundly, but seemed rather to
await a further signal.</p>

<p>Dick looked uneasily about him, spying for a hidden
danger. And sure enough, about half-way up the little
street, a door was suddenly opened from within, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
house continued, for some seconds, and both by door and
window, to disgorge a torrent of Lancastrian archers.
These, as they leaped down, hurriedly stood to their ranks,
bent their bows, and proceeded to pour upon Dick&rsquo;s rear a
flight of arrows.</p>

<p>At the same time, the assailants in the market-place
redoubled their shot, and began to close in stoutly upon the
barricade.</p>

<p>Dick called down his whole command out of the houses,
and facing them both ways, and encouraging their valour
both by word and gesture, returned as best he could the
double shower of shafts that fell about his post.</p>

<p>Meanwhile house after house was opened in the street,
and the Lancastrians continued to pour out of the doors and
leap down from the windows, shouting victory, until the
number of enemies upon Dick&rsquo;s rear was almost equal to
the number in his face. It was plain that he could hold
the post no longer; what was worse, even if he could have
held it, it had now become useless; and the whole Yorkist
army lay in a posture of helplessness upon the brink of a
complete disaster.</p>

<p>The men behind him formed the vital flaw in the general
defence; and it was upon these that Dick turned, charging
at the head of his men. So vigorous was the attack that
the Lancastrian archers gave ground and staggered, and, at
last, breaking their ranks, began to crowd back into the
houses from which they had so recently and so vaingloriously
sallied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men from the market-place had swarmed
across the undefended barricade, and fell on hotly upon the
other side; and Dick must once again face about, and proceed
to drive them back. Once again the spirit of his men
prevailed; they cleared the street in a triumphant style,
but even as they did so the others issued again out of the
houses, and took them, a third time, upon the rear.</p>

<p>The Yorkists began to be scattered; several times Dick
found himself alone among his foes and plying his bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
sword for life; several times he was conscious of a hurt.
And meanwhile the fight swayed to and fro in the street
without determinate result.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dick was aware of a great trumpeting about
the outskirts of the town. The war-cry of York began to
be rolled up to heaven, as by many and triumphant voices.
And at the same time the men in front of him began to give
ground rapidly, streaming out of the street and back upon
the market-place. Some one gave the word to fly. Trumpets
were blown distractedly, some for a rally, some to
charge. It was plain that a great blow had been struck,
and the Lancastrians were thrown, at least for the moment,
into full disorder, and some degree of panic.</p>

<p>And then, like a theatre trick, there followed the last
act of Shoreby Battle. The men in front of Richard turned
tail, like a dog that has been whistled home, and fled like
the wind. At the same moment there came through the
market-place a storm of horsemen, fleeing and pursuing,
the Lancastrians turning back to strike with the sword,
the Yorkists riding them down at the point of the
lance.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in the mellay, Dick beheld the Crookback.
He was already giving a foretaste of that furious valour and
skill to cut his way across the ranks of war, which, years
afterwards, upon the field of Bosworth, and when he was
stained with crimes, almost sufficed to change the fortunes
of the day and the destiny of the English throne. Evading,
striking, riding down, he so forced and so man&oelig;uvred his
strong horse, so aptly defended himself, and so liberally
scattered death to his opponents, that he was now far ahead
of the foremost of his knights, hewing his way, with the
truncheon of a bloody sword, to where Lord Risingham was
rallying the bravest. A moment more and they had met;
the tall, splendid, and famous warrior against the deformed
and sickly boy.</p>

<p>Yet Shelton had never a doubt of the result; and when
the fight next opened for a moment, the figure of the earl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
had disappeared; but still, in the first of the danger, Crookback
Dick was launching his big horse and plying the
truncheon of his sword.</p>

<p>Thus, by Shelton&rsquo;s courage in holding the mouth of the
street against the first attack, and by the opportune arrival
of his seven hundred reinforcements, the lad, who was afterwards
to be handed down to the execration of posterity
under the name of Richard III., had won his first considerable
fight.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE SACK OF SHOREBY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> was not a foe left within striking distance; and Dick,
as he looked ruefully about him on the remainder of his
gallant force, began to count the cost of victory. He was
himself, now that the danger was ended, so stiff and sore,
so bruised and cut and broken, and, above all, so utterly
exhausted by his desperate and unremitting labours in the
fight, that he seemed incapable of any fresh exertion.</p>

<p>But this was not yet the hour for repose. Shoreby had
been taken by assault; and though an open town, and not in
any manner to be charged with the resistance, it was plain
that these rough fighters would be not less rough now that
the fight was over, and that the more horrid part of war
would fall to be enacted. Richard of Gloucester was not
the captain to protect the citizens from his infuriated
soldiery; and, even if he had the will, it might be questioned
if he had the power.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, Dick&rsquo;s business to find and to protect
Joanna; and with that end he looked about him at the
faces of his men. The three or four who seemed likeliest
to be obedient and to keep sober he drew aside; and promising
them a rich reward and a special recommendation
to the duke, led them across the market-place, now empty
of horsemen, and into the streets upon the farther side.</p>

<p>Every here and there small combats of from two to a
dozen still raged upon the open street; here and there a
house was being besieged, the defenders throwing out stools
and tables on the heads of the assailants. The snow was
strewn with arms and corpses; but except for these partial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
combats the streets were deserted, and the houses, some
standing open, and some shuttered and barricaded, had for
the most part ceased to give out smoke.</p>

<p>Dick, threading the skirts of these skirmishers, led his
followers briskly in the direction of the abbey church; but
when he came the length of the main street a cry of horror
broke from his lips. Sir Daniel&rsquo;s great house had been
carried by assault. The gates hung in splinters from
the hinges, and a double throng kept pouring in and out
through the entrance, seeking and carrying booty. Meanwhile,
in the upper stories, some resistance was still being
offered to the pillagers; for just as Dick came within eye-shot
of the building, a casement was burst open from within,
and a poor wretch in murrey and blue, screaming and resisting,
was forced through the embrasure and tossed into
the street below.</p>

<p>The most sickening apprehension fell upon Dick. He
ran forward like one possessed, forced his way into the house
among the foremost, and mounted without pause to the
chamber on the third floor where he had last parted from
Joanna. It was a mere wreck; the furniture had been overthrown,
the cupboards broken open, and in one place a
trailing corner of the arras lay smouldering on the embers
of the fire.</p>

<p>Dick, almost without thinking, trod out the incipient
conflagration, and then stood bewildered. Sir Daniel, Sir
Oliver, Joanna, all were gone; but whether butchered in
the rout or safe escaped from Shoreby, who should say?</p>

<p>He caught a passing archer by the tabard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;were ye here when this house
was taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let be,&rdquo; said the archer. &ldquo;A murrain! let be, or I
strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark ye,&rdquo; returned Richard, &ldquo;two can play at that.
Stand and be plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man, flushed with drink and battle, struck Dick
upon the shoulder with one hand, while with the other he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
twitched away his garment. Thereupon the full wrath of
the young leader burst from his control. He seized the
fellow in his strong embrace, and crushed him on the plates
of his mailed bosom like a child; then, holding him at arm&rsquo;s-length,
he bid him speak as he valued life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray you mercy!&rdquo; gasped the archer. &ldquo;An I had
thought ye were so angry I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been charier of crossing
you. I was here indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know ye Sir Daniel?&rdquo; pursued Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well do I know him,&rdquo; returned the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he in the mansion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, he was,&rdquo; answered the archer; &ldquo;but even as
we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may &rsquo;a&rsquo; had a score of lances with him,&rdquo; said the
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lances! No women, then?&rdquo; asked Shelton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, I saw not,&rdquo; said the archer. &ldquo;But there were
none in the house, if that be your quest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Here is a piece for your
pains.&rdquo; But groping in his wallet, Dick found nothing.
&ldquo;Inquire for me to-morrow,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;Richard
Shel&mdash;&mdash;Sir Richard Shelton,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;and I will
see you handsomely rewarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then an idea struck Dick. He hastily descended
to the courtyard, ran with all his might across the garden,
and came to the great door of the church. It stood wide
open; within, every corner of the pavement was crowded
with fugitive burghers, surrounded by their families, and
laden with the most precious of their possessions, while,
at the high altar, priests in full canonicals were imploring
the mercy of God. Even as Dick entered, the loud chorus
began to thunder in the vaulted roofs.</p>

<p>He hurried through the groups of refugees, and came to
the door of the stair that led into the steeple. And here a
tall churchman stepped before him and arrested his advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither, my son?&rdquo; he asked severely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;I am here upon an
errand of expedition. Stay me not. I command here for
my Lord of Gloucester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my Lord of Gloucester?&rdquo; repeated the priest.
&ldquo;Hath, then, the battle gone so sore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The battle, father, is at an end, Lancaster clean sped,
my Lord of Risingham&mdash;Heaven rest him!&mdash;left upon the
field. And now, with your good leave, I follow mine
affairs.&rdquo; And thrusting on one side the priest, who seemed
stupefied at the news, Dick pushed open the door and
rattled up the stairs four at a bound, and without pause or
stumble, till he stepped upon the open platform at the top.</p>

<p>Shoreby Church tower not only commanded the town,
as in a map, but looked far, on both sides, over sea and land.
It was now near upon noon; the day exceeding bright, the
snow dazzling. And as Dick looked around him he could
measure the consequences of the battle.</p>

<p>A confused, growling uproar reached him from the
streets, and now and then, but very rarely, the clash of
steel. Not a ship, not so much as a skiff, remained in
harbour; but the sea was dotted with sails and row-boats
laden with fugitives. On shore, too, the surface of the
snowy meadows was broken up with bands of horsemen,
some cutting their way towards the borders of the forest,
others, who were doubtless of the Yorkist side, stoutly
interposing and beating them back upon the town. Over
all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fallen
men and horses, clearly defined upon the snow.</p>

<p>To complete the picture, those of the foot-soldiers as
had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery
combat on the borders of the port, and from the cover of
the shoreside taverns. In that quarter, also, one or two
houses had been fired, and the smoke towered high in the
frosty sunlight, and blew off to sea in voluminous folds.</p>

<p>Already close upon the margin of the woods, and somewhat
in the line of Holywood, one particular clump of fleeing
horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
tower. It was fairly numerous; in no other quarter of the
field did so many Lancastrians still hold together; thus they
had left a wide, discoloured wake upon the snow, and Dick
was able to trace them step by step from where they had left
the town.</p>

<p>While Dick stood watching them, they had gained,
unopposed, the first fringe of the leafless forest, and, turning
a little from their direction, the sun fell for a moment full
on their array, as it was relieved against the dusky wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murrey and blue!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;I swear it&mdash;murrey
and blue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment he was descending the stairway.</p>

<p>It was now his business to seek out the Duke of
Gloucester, who alone, in the disorder of the forces, might
be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men. The fighting
in the main town was now practically at an end; and as
Dick ran hither and thither, seeking the commander, the
streets were thick with wandering soldiers, some laden with
more booty than they could well stagger under, others
shouting drunk. None of them, when questioned, had the
least notion of the duke&rsquo;s whereabouts; and, at last, it was
by sheer good fortune that Dick found him, where he sat in
the saddle, directing operations to dislodge the archers from
the harbour side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Richard Shelton, ye are well found,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
owe you one thing that I value little, my life; and one that
I can never pay you for, this victory.&mdash;Catesby, if I had ten
such captains as Sir Richard, I would march forthright on
London.&mdash;But now, sir, claim your reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freely, my lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;freely and loudly. One
hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges, and taken with
him one whom I owe love and service. Give me, then, fifty
lances, that I may pursue; and for any obligation that your
graciousness is pleased to allow, it shall be clean discharged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How call ye him?&rdquo; inquired the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel Brackley,&rdquo; answered Richard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out upon him, double-face!&rdquo; cried Gloucester.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
&ldquo;Here is no reward, Sir Richard; here is fresh service
offered, and, if that ye bring his head to me, a fresh debt
upon my conscience.&mdash;Catesby, get him these lances; and
you, sir, bethink ye, in the meanwhile, what pleasure,
honour, or profit it shall be mine to give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the Yorkist skirmishers carried one of the
shoreside taverns, swarming in upon it on three sides, and
driving out or taking its defenders. Crookback Dick was
pleased to cheer the exploit, and, pushing his horse a little
nearer, called to see the prisoners.</p>

<p>There were four or five of them&mdash;two men of my Lord
Shoreby&rsquo;s and one of Lord Risingham&rsquo;s among the number,
and last, but in Dick&rsquo;s eyes not least, a tall, shambling,
grizzled old shipman, between drunk and sober, and with a
dog whimpering and jumping at his heels.</p>

<p>The young duke passed them for a moment under a
severe review.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hang them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned the other way to watch the progress of
the fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;so please you, I have found
my reward. Grant me the life and liberty of yon old
shipman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloucester turned and looked the speaker in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I make not war with peacock&rsquo;s
feathers, but steel shafts. Those that are mine
enemies I slay, and that without excuse or favour. For,
bethink ye, in this realm of England, that is so torn in
pieces, there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a
friend upon the other party. If, then, I did begin to grant
these pardons, I might sheathe my sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so, my lord; and yet I will be overbold,
and, at the risk of your disfavour, recall your lordship&rsquo;s
promise,&rdquo; replied Dick.</p>

<p>Richard of Gloucester flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark it right well,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;I love not
mercy, nor yet mercymongers. Ye have this day laid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
foundations of high fortune. If ye oppose to me my word,
which I have plighted, I will yield. But, by the glory of
heaven, there your favour dies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is the loss,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him his sailor,&rdquo; said the duke; and wheeling his
horse, he turned his back upon young Shelton.</p>

<p>Dick was nor glad nor sorry. He had seen too much
of the young duke to set great store on his affection; and
the origin and growth of his own favour had been too flimsy
and too rapid to inspire much confidence. One thing alone
he feared&mdash;that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer
of the lances. But here he did justice neither to Gloucester&rsquo;s
honour (such as it was) nor, above all, to his decision. If
he had once judged Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir
Daniel, he was not one to change; and he soon proved it by
shouting after Catesby to be speedy, for the paladin was
waiting.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Dick turned to the old shipman, who
had seemed equally indifferent to his condemnation and to
his subsequent release.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arblaster,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I have done you ill; but now,
by the rood, I think I have cleared the score.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the old skipper only looked upon him dully and held
his peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;a life is a life, old shrew,
and it is more than ships or liquor. Say ye forgive me; for
if your life is worth nothing to you, it hath cost me the beginnings
of my fortune. Come, I have paid for it dearly;
be not so churlish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An I had had my ship,&rdquo; said Arblaster, &ldquo;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo;
been forth and safe on the high seas&mdash;I and my man Tom.
But ye took my ship, gossip, and I&rsquo;m a beggar; and for
my man Tom, a knave fellow in russet shot him down.
&lsquo;Murrain!&rsquo; quoth he, and spake never again. &lsquo;Murrain&rsquo;
was the last of his words, and the poor spirit of him passed.
&rsquo;A will never sail no more will my Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
he sought to take the skipper&rsquo;s hand, but Arblaster avoided
his touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let be. Y&rsquo; have played the devil with
me, and let that content you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words died in Richard&rsquo;s throat. He saw, through
tears, the poor old man, bemused with liquor and sorrow,
go shambling away, with bowed head, across the snow, and
the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels; and for the first
time began to understand the desperate game that we play
in life, and how a thing once done is not to be changed or
remedied by any penitence.</p>

<p>But there was no time left to him for vain regret.
Catesby had now collected the horsemen, and riding up to
Dick he dismounted, and offered him his own horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was somewhat jealous of
your favour; it hath not been of a long growth; and now,
Sir Richard, it is with a very good heart that I offer you this
horse&mdash;to ride away with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suffer me yet a moment,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;This
favour of mine&mdash;whereupon was it founded?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon your name,&rdquo; answered Catesby. &ldquo;It is my
lord&rsquo;s chief superstition. Were my name Richard I should
be an earl to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I thank you,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;and, since
I am little likely to follow these great fortunes, I will even
say farewell. I will not pretend I was displeased to think
myself upon the road to fortune; but I will not pretend,
neither, that I am over-sorry to be done with it. Command
and riches, they are brave things, to be sure; but a
word in your ear&mdash;yon duke of yours, he is a fearsome
lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catesby laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of a verity he that rides with Crooked
Dick will ride deep. Well, God keep us all from evil!
Speed ye well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men, and
giving the word of command, rode off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span></p>

<p>He made straight across the town, following what he
supposed to be the route of Sir Daniel, and spying around
for any signs that might decide if he were right.</p>

<p>The streets were strewn with the dead and the wounded,
whose fate, in the bitter frost, was far the more pitiable.
Gangs of the victors went from house to house, pillaging
and stabbing, and sometimes singing together as they went.</p>

<p>From different quarters, as he rode on, the sounds of
violence and outrage came to young Shelton&rsquo;s ears; now
the blows of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door,
and now the miserable shrieks of women.</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s heart had just been awakened. He had just seen
the cruel consequences of his own behaviour; and the
thought of the sum of misery that was now acting in the
whole of Shoreby filled him with despair.</p>

<p>At length he reached the outskirts, and there, sure
enough, he saw straight before him the same broad, beaten
track across the snow that he had marked from the summit
of the church. Here, then, he went the faster on; but still,
as he rode, he kept a bright eye upon the fallen men and
horses that lay beside the track. Many of these, he was relieved
to see, wore Sir Daniel&rsquo;s colours, and the faces of
some, who lay upon their back, he even recognised.</p>

<p>About half-way between the town and the forest, those
whom he was following had plainly been assailed by archers;
for the corpses lay pretty closely scattered, each pierced by
an arrow. And here Dick spied among the rest the body
of a very young lad, whose face was somehow hauntingly
familiar to him.</p>

<p>He halted his troop, dismounted, and raised the lad&rsquo;s
head. As he did so, the hood fell back, and a profusion of
long brown hair unrolled itself. At the same time the eyes
opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! lion-driver!&rdquo; said a feeble voice. &ldquo;She is farther
on. Ride&mdash;ride fast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the poor young lady fainted once again.</p>

<p>One of Dick&rsquo;s men carried a flask of some strong cordial,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
and with this Dick succeeded in reviving consciousness.
Then he took Joanna&rsquo;s friend upon his saddle-bow, and once
more pushed toward the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do ye take me?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Ye but delay
your speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Mistress Risingham,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;Shoreby
is full of blood and drunkenness and riot. Here ye are safe;
content ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be beholden to any of your faction,&rdquo; she
cried; &ldquo;set me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, ye know not what ye say,&rdquo; returned Dick.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo; are hurt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was my horse was slain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters not one jot,&rdquo; replied Richard. &ldquo;Ye are
here in the midst of open snow, and compassed about with
enemies. Whether ye will or not, I carry you with me.
Glad am I to have the occasion; for thus shall I repay some
portion of our debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a little while she was silent. Then, very suddenly,
she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Risingham?&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;I would I
had good news to give you, madam, but I have none. I
saw him once in the battle, and once only. Let us hope the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>NIGHT IN THE WOODS: ALICIA RISINGHAM</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was almost certain that Sir Daniel had made for the
Moat House; but, considering the heavy snow, the lateness
of the hour, and the necessity under which he would lie of
avoiding the few roads and striking across the wood, it was
equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the
morrow.</p>

<p>There were two courses open to Dick: either to continue
to follow in the knight&rsquo;s trail, and, if he were able, to fall
upon him that very night in camp, or to strike out a path
of his own, and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and
his destination.</p>

<p>Either scheme was open to serious objection, and Dick,
who feared to expose Joanna to the hazards of a fight, had
not yet decided between them when he reached the borders
of the wood.</p>

<p>At this point Sir Daniel had turned a little to his left,
and then plunged straight under a grove of very lofty
timber. His party had then formed to a narrower front, in
order to pass between the trees, and the track was trod
proportionately deeper in the snow. The eye followed it,
under the leafless tracery of the oaks, running direct and
narrow; the trees stood over it, with knotty joints and the
great, uplifted forest of their boughs; there was no sound,
whether of man or beast&mdash;not so much as the stirring of a
robin; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden
among netted shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How say ye,&rdquo; asked Dick of one of the men, &ldquo;to follow
straight on, or strike across for Tunstall?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Richard,&rdquo; replied the man-at-arms, &ldquo;I would follow
the line until they scatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye are doubtless right,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;but we
came right hastily upon the errand, even as the time commanded.
Here are no houses, neither for food nor shelter,
and by the morrow&rsquo;s dawn we shall know both cold fingers
and an empty belly. How say ye, lads? Will ye stand a
pinch for expedition&rsquo;s sake, or shall we turn by Holywood
and sup with Mother Church? The case being somewhat
doubtful, I will drive no man; yet if ye would suffer me to
lead you, ye would choose the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men answered, almost with one voice, that they
would follow Sir Richard where he would.</p>

<p>And Dick, setting spur to his horse, began once more to
go forward.</p>

<p>The snow in the trail had been trodden very hard, and
the pursuers had thus a great advantage over the pursued.
They pushed on, indeed, at a round trot, two hundred hoofs
beating alternately on the dull pavement of the snow, and
the jingle of weapons and the snorting of horses raising a
warlike noise along the arches of the silent wood.</p>

<p>Presently the wide slot of the pursued came out upon the
high-road from Holywood; it was there, for a moment,
indistinguishable; and, where it once more plunged into the
unbeaten snow upon the farther side, Dick was surprised
to see it narrower and lighter trod. Plainly, profiting by
the road, Sir Daniel had begun already to scatter his
command.</p>

<p>At all hazards, one chance being equal to another, Dick
continued to pursue the straight trail; and that, after an
hour&rsquo;s riding, in which it led into the very depth of the
forest, suddenly split, like a bursting shell, into two dozen
others, leading to every point of the compass.</p>

<p>Dick drew bridle in despair. The short winter&rsquo;s day
was near an end; the sun, dull red orange, shorn of rays,
swam low among the leafless thickets; the shadows were a
mile long upon the snow; the frost bit cruelly at the fingernails;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
and the breath and steam of the horses mounted in a
cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we are outwitted,&rdquo; Dick confessed. &ldquo;Strike
we for Holywood, after all. It is still nearer us than Tunstall&mdash;or
should be by the station of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they wheeled to their left, turning their backs on the
red shield of sun, and made across country for the abbey.
But now times were changed with them; they could no
longer spank forth briskly on a path beaten firm by the passage
of their foes, and for a goal to which that path itself conducted
them. Now they must plough at a dull pace through
the encumbering snow, continually pausing to decide their
course, continually floundering in drifts. The sun soon left
them; the glow of the west decayed; and presently they
were wandering in a shadow of blackness, under frosty
stars.</p>

<p>Presently, indeed, the moon would clear the hill-tops,
and they might resume their march. But till then, every
random step might carry them wider of their march. There
was nothing for it but to camp and wait.</p>

<p>Sentries were posted; a spot of ground was cleared of
snow, and after some failures a good fire blazed in the midst.
The men-at-arms sat close about this forest hearth, sharing
such provisions as they had, and passing about the flask;
and Dick, having collected the most delicate of the rough
and scanty fare, brought it to Lord Risingham&rsquo;s niece,
where she sat apart from the soldiery against a tree.</p>

<p>She sat upon one horse-cloth, wrapped in another, and
stared straight before her at the fire-lit scene. At the offer
of food she started, like one awakened from a dream, and
then silently refused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;let me beseech you, punish me
not so cruelly. Wherein I have offended you, I know not;
I have, indeed, carried you away, but with a friendly
violence; I have, indeed, exposed you to the inclemency of
night, but the hurry that lies upon me hath for its end the
preservation of another, who is no less frail and no less unfriended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
than yourself. At least, madam, punish not yourself;
and eat, if not for hunger, then for strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear madam,&rdquo; Dick cried, &ldquo;I swear to you, upon the
rood, I touched him not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear to me that he still lives,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not palter with you,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Pity
bids me to wound you. In my heart I do believe him
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ye ask me to eat!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ay, and they
call you &lsquo;sir&rsquo;! Y&rsquo; have won your spurs by my good kinsman&rsquo;s
murder. And had I not been fool and traitor both,
and saved you in your enemy&rsquo;s house, ye should have died
the death, and he&mdash;he that was worth twelve of you&mdash;were
living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did but my man&rsquo;s best, even as your kinsman did
upon the other party,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Were he still
living&mdash;as I vow to Heaven I wish it!&mdash;he would praise, not
blame me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Daniel hath told me,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He marked
you at the barricade. Upon you, he saith, their party
foundered; it was you that won the battle. Well, then,
it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham, as sure as
though ye had strangled him. And ye would have me eat
with you&mdash;and your hands not washed from killing? But
Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall. He &rsquo;tis that will
avenge me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom. Old
Arblaster returned upon his mind, and he groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do ye hold me so guilty?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you that defended
me&mdash;you that are Joanna&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made ye in the battle?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; are
of no party; y&rsquo; are but a lad&mdash;but legs and body, without
government of wit or counsel! Wherefore did ye fight?
For the love of hurt, pardy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;I know not. But as the realm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
England goes, if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the
one side, perforce he must fight upon the other. He may
not stand alone; &rsquo;tis not in nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They that have no judgment should not draw the
sword,&rdquo; replied the young lady. &ldquo;Ye that fight but for a
hazard, what are ye but a butcher? War is but noble by
the cause, and y&rsquo; have disgraced it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the miserable Dick, &ldquo;I do partly see
mine error. I have made too much haste; I have been busy
before my time. Already I stole a ship&mdash;thinking, I do
swear it, to do well&mdash;and thereby brought about the death
of many innocent, and the grief and ruin of a poor old man
whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger.
And for this morning, I did but design to do myself credit,
and get fame to marry with, and, behold! I have brought
about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me.
And what besides, I know not. For, alas! I may have set
York upon the throne, and that may be the worser cause,
and may do hurt to England. O, madam, I do see my sin.
I am unfit for life. I will, for penance&rsquo; sake, and to avoid
worse evil, once I have finished this adventure, get me to a
cloister. I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms.
I will be a friar, and pray for your good kinsman&rsquo;s spirit all
my days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appeared to Dick, in this extremity of his humiliation
and repentance, that the young lady had laughed.</p>

<p>Raising his countenance, he found her looking down
upon him, in the fire-light, with a somewhat peculiar but
not unkind expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he cried, thinking the laughter to have been
an illusion of his hearing, but still, from her changed looks,
hoping to have touched her heart&mdash;&ldquo;madam, will not this
content you? I give up all to undo what I have done
amiss; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham. And
all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs,
and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on
ground.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O boy,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;good boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, to the extreme surprise of Dick, she first very
tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks, and then,
as if yielding to a sudden impulse, threw both her arms about
his neck, drew up his face, and kissed him. A pitiful
bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But come,&rdquo; she said, with great cheerfulness, &ldquo;you
that are a captain, ye must eat. Why sup ye not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mistress Risingham,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;I did but
wait first upon my prisoner; but, to say truth, penitence
will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food. I were
better to fast, dear lady, and to pray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Alicia,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;are we not old friends?
And now, come, I will eat with you, bit for bit and sup for
sup; so if ye eat not, neither will I; but if ye eat hearty, I
will dine like a ploughman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So there and then she fell to; and Dick, who had an
excellent stomach, proceeded to bear her company, at first
with great reluctance, but gradually, as he entered into the
spirit, with more and more vigour and devotion; until, at
last, he forgot even to watch his model, and most heartily
repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lion-driver,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;ye do not admire a
maid in a man&rsquo;s jerkin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moon was now up; and they were only waiting to
repose the wearied horses. By the moon&rsquo;s light, the still
penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat
coquettishly down upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, surprised at this new turn
in her manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;it skills not to deny; Joanna
hath told me;&mdash;but come, Sir Lion-driver, look at me&mdash;am
I so homely&mdash;come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she made bright eyes at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye are something smallish, indeed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Dick.</p>

<p>And here again she interrupted him, this time with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smallish!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Nay, now be honest as ye
are bold; I am a dwarf, or little better; but for all that&mdash;come,
tell me!&mdash;for all that, passably fair to look upon; is&rsquo;t
not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam, exceedingly fair,&rdquo; said the distressed
knight, pitifully trying to seem easy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a man would be right glad to wed me?&rdquo; she
pursued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, madam, right glad!&rdquo; agreed Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Alicia,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alicia,&rdquo; quoth Sir Richard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, lion-driver,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;sith that ye
slew my kinsman, and left me without stay, ye owe me, in
honour, every reparation; do ye not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, madam,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Although, upon my
heart, I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight&rsquo;s
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would ye evade me?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, not so. I have told you; at your bidding, I
will even turn me a monk,&rdquo; said Richard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, in honour, ye belong to me?&rdquo; she concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In honour, madam, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the young
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to!&rdquo; she interrupted; &ldquo;ye are too full of catches.
In honour do ye belong to me, till ye have paid the evil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In honour, I do,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, then,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Ye would make but
a sad friar, methinks; and since I am to dispose of you at
pleasure, I will even take you for my husband. Nay, now,
no words!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;They will avail you nothing.
For see how just it is, that you who deprived me of one home,
should supply me with another. And as for Joanna, she
will be the first, believe me, to commend the change; for,
after all, as we be dear friends, what matters it with which
of us ye wed? Not one whit!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I will go into a cloister, an ye
please to bid me; but to wed with any one in this big world
besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for
man&rsquo;s force nor yet for lady&rsquo;s pleasure. Pardon me if I
speak my plain thoughts plainly! but where a maid is very
bold, a poor man must even be the bolder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;ye sweet boy, ye must come and kiss
me for that word. Nay, fear not, ye shall kiss me for
Joanna, and when we meet, I shall give it back to her, and
say I stole it. And as for what ye owe me, why, dear
simpleton, methinks ye were not alone in that great battle;
and even if York be on the throne, it was not you that set
him there. But for a good, sweet, honest heart, Dick, y&rsquo;
are all that; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your
Joanna anything, I would even envy her your love.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>NIGHT IN THE WOODS (<i>concluded</i>)<br />
DICK AND JOAN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> horses had by this time finished the small store of provender,
and fully breathed from their fatigues. At Dick&rsquo;s
command, the fire was smothered in snow; and while his
men got once more wearily to saddle, he himself, remembering,
somewhat late, true woodland caution, chose a tall oak,
and nimbly clambered to the topmost fork. Hence he
could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest.
On the south-west, dark against the horizon, stood those
upland heathy quarters where he and Joanna had met with
the terrifying misadventure of the leper. And there his
eye was caught by a spot of ruddy brightness no bigger than
a needle&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>He blamed himself sharply for his previous neglect.
Were that, as it appeared to be, the shining of Sir Daniel&rsquo;s
camp-fire, he should long ago have seen and marched for it;
above all, he should, for no consideration, have announced
his neighbourhood by lighting a fire of his own. But now he
must no longer squander valuable hours. The direct way to
the uplands was about two miles in length; but it was crossed
by a very deep, precipitous dingle, impassable to mounted
men; and for the sake of speed, it seemed to Dick advisable
to desert the horses and attempt the adventure on foot.</p>

<p>Ten men were left to guard the horses; signals were
agreed upon by which they could communicate in case of
need; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder,
Alicia Risingham walking stoutly by his side.</p>

<p>The men had freed themselves of heavy armour, and
left behind their lances; and they now marched with a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
good spirit in the frozen snow, and under the exhilarating
lustre of the moon. The descent into the dingle, where a
stream strained sobbing through the snow and ice, was
effected with silence and order; and on the farther side,
being then within a short half-mile of where Dick had seen
the glimmer of the fire, the party halted to breathe before
the attack.</p>

<p>In the vast silence of the wood, the lightest sounds were
audible from far; and Alicia, who was keen of hearing, held
up her finger warningly, and stooped to listen. All followed
her example; but besides the groans of the choked brook
in the dingle close behind, and the barking of a fox at a
distance of many miles among the forest, to Dick&rsquo;s acutest
hearkening not a breath was audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yet, for sure, I heard the clash of harness,&rdquo;
whispered Alicia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned Dick, who was more afraid of that
young lady than of ten stout warriors, &ldquo;I would not hint
ye were mistaken; but it might well have come from either
of the camps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came not thence. It came from westward,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be what it will,&rdquo; returned Dick; &ldquo;and it must
be as Heaven please. Reck we not a jot, but push on the
livelier, and put it to the touch.&mdash;Up, friends&mdash;enough
breathed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they advanced, the snow became more and more
trampled with hoof-marks, and it was plain that they were
drawing near to the encampment of a considerable force of
mounted men. Presently they could see the smoke pouring
from among the trees, ruddily coloured on its lower
edge and scattering bright sparks.</p>

<p>And here, pursuant to Dick&rsquo;s orders, his men began to
open out, creeping stealthily in the covert, to surround on
every side the camp of their opponents. He himself,
placing Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak, stole straight
forth in the direction of the fire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span></p>

<p>At last, through an opening of the wood, his eye embraced
the scene of the encampment. The fire had been
built upon a heathy hummock of the ground, surrounded
on three sides by thicket, and it now burned very strong,
roaring aloud and brandishing flames. Around it there sat
not quite a dozen people, warmly cloaked; but though the
neighbouring snow was trampled down as by a regiment,
Dick looked in vain for any horse. He began to have a
terrible misgiving that he was out-manoeuvred. At the
same time, in a tall man with a steel salet, who was spreading
his hands before the blaze, he recognised his old friend
and still kindly enemy, Bennet Hatch; and in two others,
sitting a little back, he made out, even in their male disguise,
Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;even if I lose my
horses, let me get my Joanna, and why should I complain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, from the farther side of the encampment,
there came a little whistle, announcing that his men had
joined, and the investment was complete.</p>

<p>Bennet, at the sound, started to his feet; but ere he
had time to spring upon his arms, Dick hailed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bennet,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;Bennet, old friend, yield ye. Ye
will but spill men&rsquo;s lives in vain if ye resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Master Shelton, by St. Barbary!&rdquo; cried Hatch.
&ldquo;Yield me? Ye ask much. What force have ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Bennet, ye are both outnumbered and begirt,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;Cæsar and Charlemagne would cry for
quarter. I have two score men at my whistle, and with one
shoot of arrows I could answer for you all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Dick,&rdquo; said Bennet, &ldquo;it goes against my heart;
but I must do my duty. The saints help you!&rdquo; And
therewith he raised a little tucket to his mouth and wound
a rousing call.</p>

<p>Then followed a moment of confusion; for while Dick,
fearing for the ladies, still hesitated to give the word to
shoot, Hatch&rsquo;s little band sprang to their weapons and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
formed back to back as for a fierce resistance. In the
hurry of their change of place, Joanna sprang from her seat
and ran like an arrow to her lover&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Dick!&rdquo; she cried, as she clasped his hand in
hers.</p>

<p>But Dick still stood irresolute; he was yet young to the
more deplorable necessities of war, and the thought of old
Lady Brackley checked the command upon his tongue.
His own men became restive. Some of them cried on him
by name; others, of their own accord, began to shoot; and
at the first discharge poor Bennet bit the dust. Then Dick
awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Shoot, boys, and keep to cover.
England and York!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just then the dull beat of many horses on the snow
suddenly arose in the hollow ear of the night, and, with
incredible swiftness, drew nearer and swelled louder. At
the same time, answering tuckets repeated and repeated
Hatch&rsquo;s call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rally, rally!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Rally upon me! Rally
for your lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his men&mdash;afoot, scattered, taken in the hour when
they had counted on an easy triumph&mdash;began instead to
give ground severally, and either stood wavering or dispersed
into the thickets. And when the first of the horsemen
came charging through the open avenues and fiercely
riding their steeds into the underwood, a few stragglers were
overthrown or speared among the brush, but the bulk of Dick&rsquo;s
command had simply melted at the rumour of their coming.</p>

<p>Dick stood for a moment, bitterly recognising the fruits
of his precipitate and unwise valour. Sir Daniel had seen
the fire; he had moved out with his main force, whether to
attack his pursuers or to take them in the rear if they should
venture the assault. His had been throughout the part of
a sagacious captain; Dick&rsquo;s the conduct of an eager boy.
And here was the young knight, his sweetheart, indeed,
holding him tightly by the hand, but otherwise alone, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
whole command of men and horses dispersed in the night
and the wide forest, like a paper of pins in a hay barn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saints enlighten me!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It is well
I was knighted for this morning&rsquo;s matter; this doth me little
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thereupon, still holding Joanna, he began to run.</p>

<p>The silence of the night was now shattered by the shouts
of the men of Tunstall, as they galloped hither and thither,
hunting fugitives; and Dick broke boldly through the
underwood and ran straight before him like a deer. The
silver clearness of the moon upon the open snow increased,
by contrast, the obscurity of the thickets; and the extreme
dispersion of the vanquished led the pursuers into widely
divergent paths. Hence, in but a little while, Dick and
Joanna paused, in a close covert, and heard the sounds of
the pursuit, scattering abroad, indeed, in all directions,
but yet fainting already in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An I had but kept a reserve of them together,&rdquo; Dick
cried bitterly, &ldquo;I could have turned the tables yet! Well,
we live and learn; next time it shall go better, by the rood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Dick,&rdquo; said Joanna, &ldquo;what matters it? Here we
are, together once again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her, and there she was&mdash;John Matcham,
as of yore, in hose and doublet. But now he knew her;
now, even in that ungainly dress, she smiled upon him,
bright with love; and his heart was transported with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if ye forgive this blunderer,
what care I? Make we direct for Holywood; there lieth
your good guardian and my better friend, Lord Foxham.
There shall we be wed; and whether poor or wealthy,
famous or unknown, what matters it? This day, dear
love, I won my spurs; I was commended by great men for
my valour; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in
all broad England. Then, first, I fell out of my favour with
the great; and now I have been well thrashed, and clean
lost my soldiers. There was a downfall for conceit! But,
dear, I care not&mdash;dear, if ye still love me and will wed, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
would have my knighthood done away, and mind it not a
jot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Dick!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And did they knight you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, dear, ye are my lady now,&rdquo; he answered fondly;
&ldquo;or ye shall, ere noon to-morrow&mdash;will ye not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I, Dick, with a glad heart,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir? Methought ye were to be a monk!&rdquo; said a
voice in their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alicia!&rdquo; cried Joanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; replied the young lady, coming forward.
&ldquo;Alicia, whom ye left for dead, and whom your lion-driver
found, and brought to life again, and, by my sooth, made
love to, if ye want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not believe it,&rdquo; cried Joanna. &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; mimicked Alicia. &ldquo;Dick, indeed!&mdash;Ay, fair
sir, and ye desert poor damsels in distress,&rdquo; she continued,
turning to the young knight. &ldquo;Ye leave them planted
behind oaks. But they say true&mdash;the age of chivalry is
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; cried Dick in despair, &ldquo;upon my soul I had
forgotten you outright. Madam, ye must try to pardon me.
Ye see, I had new found Joanna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not suppose that ye had done it o&rsquo; purpose,&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;But I will be cruelly avenged. I will tell a
secret to my Lady Shelton&mdash;she that is to be,&rdquo; she added,
curtseying. &ldquo;Joanna,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I believe, upon
my soul, your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight, but he is,
let me tell you plainly, the softest-hearted simpleton in
England. Go to&mdash;ye may do your pleasure with him! And
now, fool children, first kiss me, either one of you, for luck
and kindness; and then kiss each other just one minute by
the glass, and not one second longer; and then let us all
three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir; for
these woods, methinks, are full of peril, and exceeding
cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did my Dick make love to you?&rdquo; asked Joanna,
clinging to her sweetheart&rsquo;s side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, fool girl,&rdquo; returned Alicia; &ldquo;it was I made love
to him. I offered to marry him, indeed; but he bade me
go marry with my likes. These were his words. Nay,
that I will say: he is more plain than pleasant. But now,
children, for the sake of sense, set forward. Shall we go
once more over the dingle, or push straight for Holywood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I would like dearly to get upon a
horse; for I have been sore mauled and beaten, one way and
another, these last days, and my poor body is one bruise.
But how think ye? If the men, upon the alarm of the
fighting, had fled away, we should have gone about for
nothing. &rsquo;Tis but some three short miles to Holywood
direct; the bell hath not beat nine; the snow is pretty firm
to walk upon, the moon clear; how if we went even as we
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried Alicia; but Joanna only pressed upon
Dick&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>Forth, then, they went, through open leafless groves and
down snow-clad alleys, under the white face of the winter
moon; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a
heaven of pleasure; and their light-minded companion, her
own bereavements heartily forgotten, followed a pace or
two behind, now rallying them upon their silence, and now
drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives.</p>

<p>Still, indeed, in the distance of the wood, the riders of
Tunstall might be heard urging their pursuit; and from
time to time cries or the clash of steel announced the shock
of enemies. But in these young folk, bred among the
alarms of war, and fresh from such a multiplicity of dangers,
neither fear nor pity could be lightly wakened. Content
to find the sounds still drawing farther and farther away,
they gave up their hearts to the enjoyment of the hour,
walking already, as Alicia put it, in a wedding procession;
and neither the rude solitude of the forest nor the cold of
the freezing night had any force to shadow or distract their
happiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span></p>

<p>At length, from a rising hill, they looked below them on
the dell of Holywood. The great windows of the forest
abbey shone with torch and candle; its high pinnacles and
spires arose very clear and silent, and the gold rood upon the
topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon. All about
it, in the open glade, camp-fires were burning, and the
ground was thick with huts; and across the midst of the
picture the frozen river curved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the mass,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;there are Lord Foxham&rsquo;s
fellows still encamped. The messenger hath certainly
miscarried. Well, then, so better. We have power at
hand to face Sir Daniel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But if Lord Foxham&rsquo;s men still lay encamped in the long
holm at Holywood, it was from a different reason from the
one supposed by Dick. They had marched, indeed, for
Shoreby; but ere they were half-way thither, a second
messenger met them, and bade them return to their morning&rsquo;s
camp, to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitives,
and to be so much nearer to the main army of York. For
Richard of Gloucester, having finished the battle and
stamped out his foes in that district, was already on the
march to rejoin his brother; and not long after the return
of my Lord Foxham&rsquo;s retainers, Crookback himself drew
rein before the abbey door. It was in honour of this august
visitor that the windows shone with lights; and at the hour
of Dick&rsquo;s arrival with his sweetheart and her friend, the
whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory
with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery.</p>

<p>Dick, not quite with his good will, was brought before
them. Gloucester, sick with fatigue, sat leaning upon one
hand his white and terrifying countenance; Lord Foxham,
half recovered from his wound, was in a place of honour on
his left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; asked Richard. &ldquo;Have ye brought me Sir
Daniel&rsquo;s head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke,&rdquo; replied Dick, stoutly enough, but with
a qualm at heart, &ldquo;I have not even the good fortune to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
return with my command. I have been, so please your
grace, well beaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave you fifty lances,<a name="FnAnchor_3" id="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke, I had but fifty men-at-arms,&rdquo; replied
the young knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said Gloucester. &ldquo;He did ask me fifty
lances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it please your grace,&rdquo; replied Catesby smoothly,
&ldquo;for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied Richard, adding, &ldquo;Shelton, ye may
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Lord Foxham. &ldquo;This young man likewise
had a charge from me. It may be he hath better sped.&mdash;Say,
Master Shelton, have ye found the maid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I praise the saints, my lord,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;she is in this
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it even so? Well, then, my lord the duke,&rdquo; resumed
Lord Foxham, &ldquo;with your good will, to-morrow,
before the army march, I do propose a marriage. This
young squire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young knight,&rdquo; interrupted Catesby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say ye so, Sir William?&rdquo; cried Lord Foxham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did myself, and for good service, dub him knight,&rdquo;
said Gloucester. &ldquo;He hath twice manfully served me.
It is not valour of hands, it is a man&rsquo;s mind of iron, that he
lacks. He will not rise, Lord Foxham. &rsquo;Tis a fellow that
will fight indeed bravely in a mellay, but hath a capon&rsquo;s
heart. Howbeit, if he is to marry, marry him in the name
of Mary, and be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, he is a brave lad&mdash;I know it,&rdquo; said Lord Foxham.
&ldquo;Content ye, then, Sir Richard. I have compounded this
affair with Master Hamley, and to-morrow ye shall wed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Dick judged it prudent to withdraw; but
he was not yet clear of the refectory, when a man, but newly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
alighted at the gate, came running four stairs at a bound,
and brushing through the abbey servants, threw himself on
one knee before the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Victory, my lord,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>And before Dick had got to the chamber set apart for
him as Lord Foxham&rsquo;s guest, the troops in the holm were
cheering around their fires; for upon that same day, not
twenty miles away, a second crushing blow had been dealt
to the power of Lancaster.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FnAnchor_3"><span class="fn">3</span></a> Technically, the term &ldquo;lance&rdquo; included a not quite certain

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>DICK&rsquo;S REVENGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> next morning Dick was afoot before the sun, and,
having dressed himself to the best advantage, with the aid
of the Lord Foxham&rsquo;s baggage, and got good reports of
Joan, he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience.</p>

<p>For some while he made rounds among the soldiery, who
were getting to arms in the wintry twilight of the dawn and
by the red glow of torches; but gradually he strolled farther
afield, and at length passed clean beyond the outpost, and
walked alone in the frozen forest, waiting for the sun.</p>

<p>His thoughts were both quiet and happy. His brief
favour with the duke he could not find it in his heart to
mourn; with Joan to wife, and my Lord Foxham for a
faithful patron, he looked most happily upon the future;
and in the past he found but little to regret.</p>

<p>As he thus strolled and pondered, the solemn light of
the morning grew more clear, the east was already coloured
by the sun, and a little scathing wind blew up the frozen
snow. He turned to go home; but even as he turned, his
eye lit upon a figure behind a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb
person. It was arrayed like a pilgrim, the hood lowered
over the face, but Dick, in an instant, recognised Sir Daniel.</p>

<p>He strode up to him, drawing his sword; and the knight,
putting his hand in his bosom, as if to seize a hidden weapon,
steadfastly awaited his approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dickon,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel, &ldquo;how is it to be? Do
ye make war upon the fallen?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I made no war upon your life,&rdquo; replied the lad; &ldquo;I
was your true friend until ye sought for mine; but ye have
sought for it greedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;self-defence,&rdquo; replied the knight. &ldquo;And now,
boy, the news of this battle, and the presence of yon crooked
devil here in mine own wood, have broken me beyond all
help. I go to Holywood for sanctuary; thence over-seas,
with what I can carry, and to begin life again in Burgundy
or France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may not go to Holywood,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How! May not?&rdquo; asked the knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look ye, Sir Daniel, this is my marriage morn,&rdquo; said
Dick; &ldquo;and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest
day that ever shone for me. Your life is forfeit&mdash;doubly
forfeit, for my father&rsquo;s death and your own practices to meward.
But I myself have done amiss; I have brought about
men&rsquo;s deaths; and upon this glad day I will be neither
judge nor hangman. An ye were the devil, I would not lay
a hand on you. An ye were the devil, ye might go where ye
will for me. Seek God&rsquo;s forgiveness; mine ye have freely.
But to go on to Holywood is different. I carry arms for
York, and I will suffer no spy within their lines. Hold it,
then, for certain, if ye set one foot before another, I will uplift
my voice and call the nearest post to seize you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye mock me,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel. &ldquo;I have no safety out
of Holywood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care no more,&rdquo; returned Richard. &ldquo;I let you go
east, west, or south; north I will not. Holywood is shut
against you. Go, and seek not to return. For, once ye
are gone, I will warn every post about this army, and there
will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that, once again,
were ye the very devil, ye would find it ruin to make the
essay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye doom me,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doom you not,&rdquo; returned Richard. &ldquo;If it so please
you to set your valour against mine, come on; and though
I fear it be disloyal to my party, I will take the challenge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
openly and fully, fight you with mine own single strength,
and call for none to help me. So shall I avenge my father,
with a perfect conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sir Daniel, &ldquo;y&rsquo; have a long sword against my
dagger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rely upon Heaven only,&rdquo; answered Dick, casting his
sword some way behind him on the snow. &ldquo;Now, if your
ill-fate bids you, come; and, under the pleasure of the
Almighty, I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did but try you, Dickon,&rdquo; returned the knight, with
an uneasy semblance of a laugh. &ldquo;I would not spill your
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, then, ere it be too late,&rdquo; replied Shelton. &ldquo;In
five minutes I will call the post. I do perceive that I am
too long-suffering. Had but our places been reversed, I
should have been bound hand and foot some minutes
past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dickon, I will go,&rdquo; replied Sir Daniel. &ldquo;When
we next meet, it shall repent you that ye were so harsh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with these words, the knight turned and began to
move off under the trees. Dick watched him with strangely
mingled feelings, as he went, swiftly and warily, and ever
and again turning a wicked eye upon the lad who had spared
him, and whom he still suspected.</p>

<p>There was upon one side of where he went a thicket
strongly matted with green ivy, and, even in its winter state,
impervious to the eye. Herein, all of a sudden, a bow
sounded like a note of music. An arrow flew, and with a
great, choked cry of agony and anger, the Knight of Tunstall
threw up his hands and fell forward in the snow.</p>

<p>Dick bounded to his side and raised him. His face
desperately worked; his whole body was shaken by contorting
spasms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the arrow black?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is black,&rdquo; replied Dick gravely.</p>

<p>And then, before he could add one word, a desperate
seizure of pain shook the wounded man from head to foot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
so that his body leaped in Dick&rsquo;s supporting arms, and with
the extremity of that pang his spirit fled in silence.</p>

<p>The young man laid him back gently on the snow and
prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit, and as he
prayed the sun came up at a bound, and the robins began
chirping in the ivy.</p>

<p>When he rose to his feet, he found another man upon his
knees but a few steps behind him, and, still with uncovered
head, he waited until that prayer also should be over. It
took long; the man, with his head bowed and his face
covered with his hands, prayed like one in a great disorder
or distress of mind; and by the bow that lay beside him,
Dick judged that he was no other than the archer who had
laid Sir Daniel low.</p>

<p>At length he also rose, and showed the countenance of
Ellis Duckworth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; he said, very gravely, &ldquo;I heard you. Ye
took the better part and pardoned; I took the worse, and
there lies the clay of mine enemy. Pray for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he wrung him by the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;I will pray for you, indeed;
though how I may prevail I wot not. But if ye have so
long pursued revenge, and find it now of such a sorry flavour,
bethink ye, were it not well to pardon others? Hatch&mdash;he
is dead, poor shrew! I would have spared a better; and
for Sir Daniel, here lies his body. But for the priest, if I
might anywise prevail, I would have you let him go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flash came into the eyes of Ellis Duckworth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the devil is still strong within me.
But be at rest; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore&mdash;the
fellowship is broken. They that still live shall come to
their quiet and ripe end, in Heaven&rsquo;s good time, for me;
and for yourself, go where your better fortune calls you,
and think no more of Ellis.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">About</span> nine in the morning Lord Foxham was leading his
ward, once more dressed as befitted her sex, and followed
by Alicia Risingham, to the church of Holywood, when
Richard Crookback, his brow already heavy with cares,
crossed their path and paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the maid?&rdquo; he asked; and when Lord Foxham
had replied in the affirmative, &ldquo;Minion,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;hold
up your face until I see its favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked upon her sourly for a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye are fair,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and, as they tell me,
dowered. How if I offered you a brave marriage, as became
your face and parentage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke,&rdquo; replied Joanna, &ldquo;may it please your
grace, I had rather wed with Sir Richard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; he asked harshly. &ldquo;Marry but the man
I name to you, and he shall be my lord, and you my lady,
before night. For Sir Richard, let me tell you plainly, he
will die Sir Richard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask no more of Heaven, my lord, than but to die Sir
Richard&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; returned Joanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look ye at that, my lord,&rdquo; said Gloucester, turning to
Lord Foxham. &ldquo;Here be a pair for you. The lad, when
for good services I gave him his choice of my favour, chose
but the grace of an old drunken shipman. I did warn him
freely, but he was stout in his besottedness. &lsquo;Here dieth
your favour,&rsquo; said I: and he, my lord, with a most assured
impertinence, &lsquo;Mine be the loss,&rsquo; quoth he. It shall be so,
by the rood!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Said he so?&rdquo; cried Alicia. &ldquo;Then well said, lion-driver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; asked the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A prisoner of Sir Richard&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Lord Foxham;
&ldquo;Mistress Alicia Risingham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that she be married to a sure man,&rdquo; said the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thought of my kinsman, Hamley, an it like your
grace,&rdquo; returned Lord Foxham. &ldquo;He hath well served the
cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It likes me well,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Let them be
wedded speedily.&mdash;Say, fair maid, will you wed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord duke,&rdquo; said Alicia, &ldquo;so as the man is
straight&mdash;&rdquo; And there, in a perfect consternation, the
voice died on her tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is straight, my mistress,&rdquo; replied Richard calmly.
&ldquo;I am the only crookback of my party; we are else passably
well shapen.&mdash;Ladies, and you, my lord,&rdquo; he added, with a
sudden change to grave courtesy, &ldquo;judge me not too churlish
if I leave you. A captain, in the time of war, hath not the
ordering of his hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a very handsome salutation he passed on,
followed by his officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alack,&rdquo; cried Alicia, &ldquo;I am shent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye know him not,&rdquo; replied Lord Foxham. &ldquo;It is but
a trifle; he hath already clean forgot your words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, then, the very flower of knighthood,&rdquo; said
Alicia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but he mindeth other things,&rdquo; returned Lord
Foxham. &ldquo;Tarry we no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the chancel they found Dick waiting, attended by a
few young men; and there were he and Joan united. When
they came forth again, happy and yet serious, into the frosty
air and sunlight, the long flies of the army were already
winding forward up the road; already the Duke of
Gloucester&rsquo;s banner was unfolded and began to move from
before the abbey in a clump of spears; and behind it, girt
by steel-clad knights, the bold, black-hearted, and ambitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
hunchback moved on towards his brief kingdom and his
lasting infamy. But the wedding party turned upon the
other side, and sat down, with sober merriment, to breakfast.
The father cellarer attended on their wants, and sat
with them at table. Hamley, all jealousy forgotten, began
to ply the nowise loath Alicia with courtship. And there,
amid the sounding of tuckets and the clash of armoured
soldiery and horses continually moving forth, Dick and
Joan sat side by side, tenderly held hands, and looked, with
ever growing affection, in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch
passed them by. They dwelt apart from alarms in the green
forest where their love began.</p>

<p>Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great
prosperity and peace, and with perhaps a superfluity of ale
and wine, in Tunstall hamlet. One had been all his life a
shipman, and continued to the last to lament his man Tom.
The other, who had been a bit of everything, turned in the
end towards piety, and made a most religious death under
the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey.
So Lawless had his will, and died a friar.</p>

<h2>MARKHEIM</h2>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;</span> said the dealer, &ldquo;our windfalls are of various kinds.
Some customers are ignorant, and then I touch a dividend
on my superior knowledge. Some are dishonest,&rdquo; and here
he held up the candle, so that the light fell strongly on his
visitor, &ldquo;and in that case,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I profit by my
virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Markheim had but just entered from the daylight streets,
and his eyes had not yet grown familiar with the mingled
shine and darkness in the shop. At these pointed words,
and before the near presence of the flame, he blinked painfully
and looked aside.</p>

<p>The dealer chuckled. &ldquo;You come to me on Christmas
Day,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;when you know that I am alone in my
house, put up my shutters, and make a point of refusing
business. Well, you will have to pay for that; you will
have to pay for my loss of time, when I should be balancing
my books; you will have to pay, besides, for a kind of
manner that I remark in you to-day very strongly. I am
the essence of discretion, and ask no awkward questions;
but when a customer cannot look me in the eye, he has to
pay for it.&rdquo; The dealer once more chuckled; and then,
changing to his usual business voice, though still with a note
of irony, &ldquo;You can give, as usual, a clear account of how you
came into the possession of the object?&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Still your uncle&rsquo;s cabinet? A remarkable collector,
sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little pale, round-shouldered dealer stood
almost on tip-toe, looking over the top of his gold spectacles,
and nodding his head with every mark of disbelief. Markheim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
returned his gaze with one of infinite pity, and a touch
of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are in error. I have not
come to sell, but to buy. I have no curios to dispose of;
my uncle&rsquo;s cabinet is bare to the wainscot; even were it
still intact, I have done well on the Stock Exchange, and
should more likely add to it than otherwise, and my errand
to-day is simplicity itself. I seek a Christmas present for a
lady,&rdquo; he continued, waxing more fluent as he struck into
the speech he had prepared; &ldquo;and certainly I owe you every
excuse for thus disturbing you upon so small a matter.
But the thing was neglected yesterday; I must produce my
little compliment at dinner; and, as you very well know, a
rich marriage is not a thing to be neglected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There followed a pause, during which the dealer seemed
to weigh this statement incredulously. The ticking of
many clocks among the curious lumber of the shop, and the
faint rushing of the cabs in a near thoroughfare, filled up
the interval of silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the dealer, &ldquo;be it so. You are an old
customer after all; and if, as you say, you have the chance
of a good marriage, far be it from me to be an obstacle.&mdash;Here
is a nice thing for a lady now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this
hand-glass&mdash;fifteenth-century, warranted; comes from a
good collection, too; but I reserve the name, in the interests
of my customer, who was just like yourself, my dear sir,
the nephew and sole heir of a remarkable collector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer, while he thus ran on in his dry and biting
voice, had stooped to take the object from its place; and,
as he had done so, a shock had passed through Markheim,
a start both of hand and foot, a sudden leap of many
tumultuous passions to the face. It passed as swiftly as it
came, and left no trace beyond a certain trembling of the
hand that now received the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glass,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, and then paused, and repeated
it more clearly. &ldquo;A glass? For Christmas?
Surely not?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; cried the dealer. &ldquo;Why not a
glass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Markheim was looking upon him with an indefinable
expression. &ldquo;You ask me why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why,
look here&mdash;look in it&mdash;look at yourself! Do you like to see
it? No! nor I&mdash;nor any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little man had jumped back when Markheim had
so suddenly confronted him with the mirror; but now, perceiving
there was nothing worse on hand, he chuckled.
&ldquo;Your future lady, sir, must be pretty hard favoured,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask you,&rdquo; said Markheim, &ldquo;for a Christmas present,
and you give me this&mdash;this damned reminder of years, and
sins and follies&mdash;this hand-conscience. Did you mean it?
Had you a thought in your mind? Tell me. It will be
better for you if you do. Come, tell me about yourself.
I hazard a guess now, that you are in secret a very charitable
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer looked closely at his companion. It was very
odd, Markheim did not appear to be laughing; there was
something in his face like an eager sparkle of hope, but
nothing of mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; the dealer asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not charitable?&rdquo; returned the other gloomily. &ldquo;Not
charitable? not pious; not scrupulous; unloving, unbeloved;
a hand to get money, a safe to keep it. Is that all?
Dear God, man, is that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what it is,&rdquo; began the dealer, with some
sharpness, and then broke off again into a chuckle. &ldquo;But
I see this is a love-match of yours, and you have been
drinking the lady&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Markheim, with a strange curiosity.
&ldquo;Ah, have you been in love? Tell me about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; cried the dealer. &ldquo;I in love! I never had the
time, nor have I the time to-day for all this nonsense.&mdash;Will
you take the glass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the hurry?&rdquo; returned Markheim. &ldquo;It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
very pleasant to stand here talking; and life is so short and
insecure that I would not hurry away from any pleasure&mdash;no,
not even from so mild a one as this. We should rather
cling, cling to what little we can get, like a man at a cliff&rsquo;s
edge. Every second is a cliff, if you think upon it&mdash;a cliff
a mile high&mdash;high enough, if we fall, to dash us out of every
feature of humanity. Hence it is best to talk pleasantly.
Let us talk of each other: why should we wear this mask?
Let us be confidential. Who knows?&mdash;we might become
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just one word to say to you,&rdquo; said the dealer.
&ldquo;Either make your purchase, or walk out of my shop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said Markheim. &ldquo;Enough fooling. To
business. Show me something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer stooped once more, this time to replace the
glass upon the shelf, his thin blond hair falling over his eyes
as he did so. Markheim moved a little nearer, with one
hand in the pocket of his greatcoat: he drew himself up and
filled his lungs; at the same time many different emotions
were depicted together on his face&mdash;terror, horror, and
resolve, fascination and a physical repulsion; and through
a haggard lift of his upper lip his teeth looked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, perhaps, may suit,&rdquo; observed the dealer: and
then, as he began to re-arise, Markheim bounded from behind
upon his victim. The long, skewer-like dagger flashed
and fell. The dealer struggled like a hen, striking his
temple on the shelf, and then tumbled on the floor in a
heap.</p>

<p>Time had some score of small voices in that shop, some
stately and slow, as was becoming to their great age; others
garrulous and hurried. All these told out the seconds in an
intricate chorus of tickings. Then the passage of a lad&rsquo;s
feet, heavily running on the pavement, broke in upon these
smaller voices and startled Markheim into the consciousness
of his surroundings. He looked about him awfully.
The candle stood on the counter, its flame solemnly wagging
in a draught; and by that inconsiderable movement the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
whole room was filled with noiseless bustle and kept heaving
like a sea: the tall shadows nodding, the gross blots of darkness
swelling and dwindling as with respiration, the faces
of the portraits and the china gods changing and wavering
like images in water. The inner door stood ajar, and peered
into that leaguer of shadows with a long slit of daylight like
a pointing finger.</p>

<p>From these fear-stricken rovings Markheim&rsquo;s eyes returned
to the body of his victim, where it lay both humped
and sprawling, incredibly small and strangely meaner than
in life. In these poor, miserly clothes, in that ungainly
attitude, the dealer lay like so much sawdust. Markheim
had feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing. And yet, as
he gazed, this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began
to find eloquent voices. There it must lie; there was none
to work the cunning hinges or direct the miracle of locomotion&mdash;there
it must lie till it was found. Found! ay,
and then? Then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that
would ring over England, and fill the world with the echoes
of pursuit. Ay, dead or not, this was still the enemy.
&ldquo;Time was that when the brains were out,&rdquo; he thought;
and the first word struck into his mind. Time, now that
the deed was accomplished&mdash;time, which had closed for
the victim, had become instant and momentous for the
slayer.</p>

<p>The thought was yet in his mind when, first one and then
another, with every variety of pace and voice&mdash;one deep
as the bell from a cathedral turret, another ringing on its
treble notes the prelude of a waltz&mdash;the clocks began to
strike the hour of three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb
chamber staggered him. He began to bestir himself, going
to and fro with the candle, beleaguered by moving shadows,
and startled to the soul by chance reflections. In many
rich mirrors, some of home design, some from Venice or
Amsterdam, he saw his face repeated and repeated, as it
were an army of spies; his own eyes met and detected him;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
and the sound of his own steps, lightly as they fell, vexed
the surrounding quiet. And still, as he continued to fill his
pockets, his mind accused him, with a sickening iteration,
of the thousand faults of his design. He should have
chosen a more quiet hour; he should have prepared an
alibi; he should not have used a knife; he should have been
more cautious, and only bound and gagged the dealer, and
not killed him; he should have been more bold, and killed
the servant also; he should have done all things otherwise:
poignant regrets, weary, incessant toiling of the mind to
change what was unchangeable, to plan what was now useless,
to be the architect of the irrevocable past. Meanwhile,
and behind all this activity, brute terrors, like the scurrying
of rats in a deserted attic, filled the more remote chambers
of his brain with riot; the hand of the constable would fall
heavy on his shoulder, and his nerves would jerk like a
hooked fish; or he beheld, in galloping defile, the dock, the
prison, the gallows, and the black coffin.</p>

<p>Terror of the people in the street sat down before his
mind like a besieging army. It was impossible, he thought,
but that some rumour of the struggle must have reached their
ears and set on edge their curiosity; and now, in all the
neighbouring houses, he divined them sitting motionless
and with uplifted ear&mdash;solitary people, condemned to spend
Christmas dwelling alone on memories of the past, and now
startlingly recalled from that tender exercise; happy family
parties, struck into silence round the table, the mother still
with raised finger: every degree and age and humour, but
all, by their own hearths, prying and hearkening and weaving
the rope that was to hang him. Sometimes it seemed
to him he could not move too softly; the clink of the tall
Bohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell; and alarmed
by the bigness of the ticking, he was tempted to stop the
clocks. And then, again, with a swift transition of his
terrors, the very silence of the place appeared a source of
peril, and a thing to strike and freeze the passer-by; and he
would step more boldly, and bustle aloud among the contents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
of the shop, and imitate, with elaborate bravado, the
movements of a busy man at ease in his own house.</p>

<p>But he was now so pulled about by different alarms,
that, while one portion of his mind was still alert and
cunning, another trembled on the brink of lunacy. One
hallucination in particular took a strong hold on his credulity.
The neighbour hearkening with white face beside his
window, the passer-by arrested by a horrible surmise on the
pavement&mdash;these could at worst suspect, they could not
know; through the brick walls and shuttered windows only
sounds could penetrate. But here, within the house, was
he alone? He knew he was; he had watched the servant
set forth sweethearting, in her poor best, &ldquo;out for the day&rdquo;
written on every ribbon and smile. Yes, he was alone, of
course; and yet, in the bulk of empty house above him, he
could surely hear a stir of delicate footing&mdash;he was surely
conscious, inexplicably conscious, of some presence. Ay,
surely; to every room and corner of the house his imagination
followed it; and now it was a faceless thing, and yet
had eyes to see with; and again it was a shadow of himself;
and yet again beheld the image of the dead dealer, reinspired
with cunning and hatred.</p>

<p>At times, with a strong effort, he would glance at the
open door which still seemed to repel his eyes. The house
was tall, the skylight small and dirty, the day blind with
fog; and the light that filtered down to the ground story
was exceedingly faint, and showed dimly on the threshold
of the shop. And yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness,
did there not hang wavering a shadow?</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the street outside, a very jovial gentleman
began to beat with a staff on the shop-door, accompanying
his blows with shouts and railleries in which the
dealer was continually called upon by name. Markheim,
smitten into ice, glanced at the dead man. But no! he
lay quite still; he was fled away far beyond ear-shot of these
blows and shoutings; he was sunk beneath seas of silence;
and his name, which would once have caught his notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
above the howling of a storm, had become an empty sound.
And presently the jovial gentleman desisted from his knocking
and departed.</p>

<p>Here was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be
done, to get forth from this accusing neighbourhood, to
plunge into a bath of London multitudes, and to reach, on
the other side of day, that haven of safety and apparent
innocence&mdash;his bed. One visitor had come: at any
moment another might follow and be more obstinate. To
have done the deed, and yet not to reap the profit, would
be too abhorrent a failure. The money, that was now
Markheim&rsquo;s concern; and as a means to that, the keys.</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the open door; where
the shadow was still lingering and shivering; and with no
conscious repugnance of the mind, yet with a tremor of the
belly, he drew near the body of his victim. The human
character had quite departed. Like a suit half-stuffed with
bran, the limbs lay scattered, the trunk doubled, on the
floor; and yet the thing repelled him. Although so dingy
and inconsiderable to the eye, he feared it might have more
significance to the touch. He took the body by the shoulders
and turned it on its back. It was strangely light and supple,
and the limbs, as if they had been broken, fell into the
oddest postures. The face was robbed of all expression; but
it was as pale as wax, and shockingly smeared with blood
about one temple. That was, for Markheim, the one displeasing
circumstance. It carried him back, upon the instant,
to a certain fair-day in a fishers&rsquo; village: a grey day,
a piping wind, a crowd upon the street, a blare of brasses,
the booming of drums, the nasal voice of a ballad-singer;
and a boy going to and fro, buried overhead in the crowd
and divided between interest and fear, until, coming out
upon the chief place of concourse, he beheld a booth and a
great screen with pictures, dismally designed, garishly
coloured: Brownrigg with her apprentice; the Mannings
with their murdered guest; Weare in the death-grip of
Thurtell; and a score besides of famous crimes. The thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
was as clear as an illusion; he was once again that little
boy; he was looking once again, and with the same sense of
physical revolt, at these vile pictures; he was still stunned
by the thumping of the drums. A bar of that day&rsquo;s music
returned upon his memory; and at that, for the first time,
a qualm came over him, a breath of nausea, a sudden weakness
of the joints, which he must instantly resist and conquer.</p>

<p>He judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from
these considerations; looking the more hardily in the dead
face, bending his mind to realise the nature and greatness
of his crime. So little a while ago that face had moved with
every change of sentiment, that pale mouth had spoken,
that body had been all on fire with governable energies;
and now, and by his act, that piece of life had been arrested,
as the horologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating
of the clock. So he reasoned in vain; he could rise to
no more remorseful consciousness; the same heart which
had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime looked on
its reality unmoved. At best, he felt a gleam of pity for
one who had been endowed in vain with all those faculties
that can make the world a garden of enchantment, one who
had never lived and who was now dead. But of penitence,
no, not a tremor.</p>

<p>With that, shaking himself clear of these considerations,
he found the keys and advanced towards the open door of
the shop. Outside, it had begun to rain smartly; and the
sound of the shower upon the roof had banished silence.
Like some dripping cavern, the chambers of the house were
haunted by an incessant echoing, which filled the ear and
mingled with the ticking of the clocks. And, as Markheim
approached the door, he seemed to hear, in answer to his
own cautious tread, the steps of another foot withdrawing
up the stair. The shadow still palpitated loosely on the
threshold. He threw a ton&rsquo;s weight of resolve upon his
muscles, and drew back the door.</p>

<p>The faint, foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
floor and stairs; on the bright suit of armour posted, halbert
in hand, upon the landing: and on the dark wood-carvings,
and framed pictures that hung against the yellow panels of
the wainscot. So loud was the beating of the rain through
all the house that, in Markheim&rsquo;s ears, it began to be distinguished
into many different sounds. Footsteps and
sighs, the tread of regiments marching in the distance, the
chink of money in the counting, and the creaking of doors
held stealthily ajar, appeared to mingle with the patter of
the drops upon the cupola and the gushing of the water in
the pipes. The sense that he was not alone grew upon him
to the verge of madness. On every side he was haunted and
begirt by presences. He heard them moving in the upper
chambers; from the shop he heard the dead man getting to
his legs; and as he began with a great effort to mount the
stairs, feet fled quietly before him and followed stealthily
behind. If he were but deaf, he thought, how tranquilly
he would possess his soul! And then again, and hearkening
with ever fresh attention, he blessed himself for that unresting
sense which held the outposts and stood a trusty
sentinel upon his life. His head turned continually on his
neck; his eyes, which seemed starting from their orbits,
scouted on every side, and on every side were half-rewarded
as with the tail of something nameless vanishing. The
four-and-twenty steps to the first floor were four-and-twenty
agonies.</p>

<p>On that first story, the doors stood ajar, three of them
like three ambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of
cannon. He could never again, he felt, be sufficiently
immured and fortified from men&rsquo;s observing eyes; he
longed to be home, girt in by walls, buried among bed-clothes,
and invisible to all but God. And at that thought
he wondered a little, recollecting tales of other murderers
and the fear they were said to entertain of heavenly avengers.
It was not so, at least, with him. He feared the laws of
nature, lest, in their callous and immutable procedure, they
should preserve some damning evidence of his crime. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
feared tenfold more, with a slavish, superstitious terror,
some scission in the continuity of man&rsquo;s experience, some
wilful illegality of nature. He played a game of skill, depending
on the rules, calculating consequence from cause;
and what if nature, as the defeated tyrant overthrew the
chess-board, should break the mould of their succession?
The like had befallen Napoleon (so writers said) when the
winter changed the time of its appearance. The like might
befall Markheim: the solid walls might become transparent
and reveal his doings like those of bees in a glass hive;
the stout planks might yield under his foot like quicksands
and detain him in their clutch; ay, and there were soberer
accidents that might destroy him: if, for instance, the house
should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim;
or the house next door should fly on fire, and the firemen invade
him from all sides. These things he feared; and, in
a sense, these things might be called the hands of God
reached forth against sin. But about God Himself he was
at ease: his act was doubtless exceptional, but so were his
excuses, which God knew; it was there, and not among men,
that he felt sure of justice.</p>

<p>When he had got safe into the drawing-room, and shut
the door behind him, he was aware of a respite from alarms.
The room was quite dismantled, uncarpeted besides, and
strewn with packing-cases and incongruous furniture;
several great pier-glasses, in which he beheld himself at
various angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures,
framed and unframed, standing with their faces to the wall;
a fine Sheraton sideboard, a cabinet of marquetry, and a
great old bed, with tapestry hangings. The windows
opened to the floor; but by great good fortune the lower
part of the shutters had been closed, and this concealed him
from the neighbours. Here, then, Markheim drew in a
packing-case before the cabinet, and began to search among
the keys. It was a long business, for there were many; and
it was irksome besides; for, after all, there might be nothing
in the cabinet, and time was on the wing. But the closeness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
of the occupation sobered him. With the tail of his
eye he saw the door&mdash;even glanced at it from time to time
directly, like a besieged commander, pleased to verify the
good estate of his defences. But in truth he was at peace.
The rain falling in the street sounded natural and pleasant.
Presently, on the other side, the notes of a piano were
wakened to the music of a hymn, and the voices of many
children took up the air and words. How stately, how comfortable
was the melody! How fresh the youthful voices!
Markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he sorted out the keys;
and his mind was thronged with answerable ideas and
images; church-going children and the pealing of the high
organ; children afield, bathers by the brookside, ramblers
on the brambly common, kite-flyers in the windy and cloud-navigated
sky; and then, at another cadence of the hymn,
back again to church, and the somnolence of summer
Sundays, and the high genteel voice of the parson (which he
smiled a little to recall) and the painted Jacobean tombs,
and the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments in the
chancel.</p>

<p>And as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was
startled to his feet. A flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting
gush of blood went over him, and then he stood transfixed
and thrilling. A step mounted the stair slowly and steadily,
and presently a hand was laid upon the knob, and the lock
clicked, and the door opened.</p>

<p>Fear held Markheim in a vice. What to expect he knew
not, whether the dead man walking, or the official ministers
of human justice, or some chance witness blindly stumbling
in to consign him to the gallows. But when a face was
thrust into the aperture, glanced round the room, looked
at him, nodded and smiled as if in friendly recognition, and
then withdrew again, and the door closed behind it, his fear
broke loose from his control in a hoarse cry. At the sound
of this the visitant returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you call me?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly, and with that
he entered the room and closed the door behind him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span></p>

<p>Markheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes.
Perhaps there was a film upon his sight, but the outlines of
the new-comer seemed to change and waver like those of
the idols in the wavering candlelight of the shop; and at
times he thought he knew him; and at times he thought he
bore a likeness to himself; and always, like a lump of living
terror, there lay in his bosom the conviction that this thing
was not of the earth and not of God.</p>

<p>And yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace,
as he stood looking on Markheim with a smile; and
when he added: &ldquo;You are looking for the money, I believe?&rdquo;
it was in the tones of everyday politeness.</p>

<p>Markheim made no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should warn you,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;that the
maid has left her sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon
be here. If Mr. Markheim be found in this house, I need
not describe to him the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; cried the murderer.</p>

<p>The visitor smiled. &ldquo;You have long been a favourite
of mine,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I have long observed and often
sought to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; cried Markheim, &ldquo;the devil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I may be,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;cannot affect
the service I propose to render you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can,&rdquo; cried Markheim; &ldquo;it does! Be helped by
you? No, never; not by you! You do not know me yet;
thank God, you do not know me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; replied the visitant, with a sort of
kind severity, or rather firmness. &ldquo;I know you to the
soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know me!&rdquo; cried Markheim. &ldquo;Who can do so?
My life is but a travesty and slander on myself. I have lived
to belie my nature. All men do; all men are better than
this disguise, that grows about and stifles them. You see
each dragged away by life, like one whom bravos have
seized and muffled in a cloak. If they had their own control&mdash;if
you could see their faces, they would be altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
different, they would shine out for heroes and saints! I
am worse than most; myself is more overlaid; my excuse
is known to me and God. But, had I the time, I could
disclose myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; inquired the visitant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To you before all,&rdquo; returned the murderer. &ldquo;I
supposed you were intelligent. I thought&mdash;since you exist&mdash;you
would prove a reader of the heart. And yet you
would propose to judge me by my acts! Think of it; my
acts! I was born and I have lived in a land of giants; giants
have dragged me by the wrists since I was born out of my
mother&mdash;the giants of circumstance. And you would
judge me by my acts! But can you not look within? Can
you not understand that evil is hateful to me? Can you
not see within me the clear writing of conscience, never
blurred by any wilful sophistry, although too often disregarded?
Can you not read me for a thing that surely must
be common as humanity&mdash;the unwilling sinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this is very feelingly expressed,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;but it regards me not. These points of consistency are
beyond my province, and I care not in the least by what
compulsion you may have been dragged away, so as you
are but carried in the right direction. But time flies; the
servant delays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the
pictures on the hoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer;
and remember, it is as if the gallows itself was striding towards
you through the Christmas streets! Shall I help you;
I, who know all? Shall I tell you where to find the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what price?&rdquo; asked Markheim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I offer you the service for a Christmas gift,&rdquo; returned
the other.</p>

<p>Markheim could not refrain from smiling with a kind
of bitter triumph. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will take nothing at
your hands; if I were dying of thirst, and it was your hand
that put the pitcher to my lips, I should find the courage
to refuse. It may be credulous, but I will do nothing to
commit myself to evil.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to a death-bed repentance,&rdquo;
observed the visitant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you disbelieve their efficacy!&rdquo; Markheim
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not say so,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;but I look on
these things from a different side, and when the life is done
my interest falls. The man has lived to serve me, to spread
black looks under colour of religion, or to sow tares in the
wheat-field, as you do, in a course of weak compliance with
desire. Now that he draws so near to his deliverance, he
can add but one act of service&mdash;to repent, to die smiling,
and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more
timorous of my surviving followers. I am not so hard a
master. Try me. Accept my help. Please yourself in
life as you have done hitherto; please yourself more amply,
spread your elbows at the board; and when the night begins
to fall and the curtains to be drawn, I tell you, for your
greater comfort, that you will find it even easy to compound
your quarrel with your conscience, and to make a
truckling peace with God. I came but now from such a
death-bed, and the room was full of sincere mourners,
listening to the man&rsquo;s last words: and when I looked into
that face, which had been set as a flint against mercy, I
found it smiling with hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you, then, suppose me such a creature?&rdquo;
asked Markheim. &ldquo;Do you think I have no more generous
aspirations than to sin, and sin, and sin, and, at the last,
sneak into heaven? My heart rises at the thought. Is
this, then, your experience of mankind? or is it because
you find me with red hands that you presume such baseness?
and is this crime of murder indeed so impious as to
dry up the very springs of good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder is to me no special category,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;All sins are murder, even as all life is war. I behold your
race, like starving mariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of
the hands of famine and feeding on each other&rsquo;s lives. I
follow sins beyond the moment of their acting; I find in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
that the last consequence is death; and to my eyes, the
pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such taking
graces on a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with
human gore than such a murderer as yourself. Do I say
that I follow sins? I follow virtues also; they differ not
by the thickness of a nail, they are both scythes for the reaping
angel of Death. Evil, for which I live, consists not in
action but in character. The bad man is dear to me;
not the bad act, whose fruits, if we could follow them
far enough down the hurtling cataract of the ages,
might yet be found more blessed than those of the rarest
virtues. And it is not because you have killed a dealer,
but because you are Markheim, that I offer to forward your
escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lay my heart open to you,&rdquo; answered Markheim.
&ldquo;This crime on which you find me is my last. On my way
to it I have learned many lessons; itself is a lesson, a
momentous lesson. Hitherto I have been driven with revolt
to what I would not; I was a bond-slave to poverty,
driven and scourged. There are robust virtues that can
stand in these temptations; mine was not so: I had a thirst
of pleasure. But to-day, and out of this deed, I pluck both
warning and riches&mdash;both the power and a fresh resolve to
be myself. I become in all things a free actor in the world;
I begin to see myself all changed, these hands the agents of
good, this heart at peace. Something comes over me out
of the past; something of what I have dreamed on Sabbath
evenings to the sound of the church organ, of what I forecast
when I shed tears over noble books, or talked, an innocent
child, with my mother. There lies my life; I have
wandered a few years, but now I see once more my city of
destination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to use this money on the Stock Exchange, I
think?&rdquo; remarked the visitor; &ldquo;and there, if I mistake
not, you have already lost some thousands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Markheim, &ldquo;but this time I have a sure
thing.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, again, you will lose,&rdquo; replied the visitor
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I will keep back the half!&rdquo; cried Markheim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That also you will lose,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>The sweat started upon Markheim&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Well,
then, what matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Say it be lost, say
I am plunged again in poverty, shall one part of me, and
that the worse, continue until the end to override the better?
Evil and good run strong in me, haling me both ways. I
do not love the one thing, I love all. I can conceive great
deeds, renunciations, martyrdoms; and though I be fallen
to such a crime as murder, pity is no stranger to my thoughts.
I pity the poor; who knows their trials better than myself?
I pity and help them; I prize love, I love honest laughter;
there is no good thing nor true thing on earth but I love it
from my heart. And are my vices only to direct my life,
and my virtues to lie without effect, like some passive
lumber of the mind? Not so; good, also, is the spring of
acts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the visitant raised his finger. &ldquo;For six-and-thirty
years that you have been in this world,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;through
many changes of fortune and varieties of humour, I have
watched you steadily fall. Fifteen years ago you would
have started at a theft. Three years back you would have
blenched at the name of murder. Is there any crime, is
there any cruelty or meanness, from which you still recoil?&mdash;five
years from now I shall detect you in the fact! Downward,
downward lies your way; nor can anything but death
avail to stop you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; Markheim said huskily, &ldquo;I have in some
degree complied with evil. But it is so with all: the very
saints, in the mere exercise of living, grow less dainty, and
take on the tone of their surroundings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will propound to you one simple question,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;and as you answer, I shall read to you your moral
horoscope. You have grown in many things more lax;
possibly you do right to be so; and at any account, it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
same with all men. But granting that, are you in any one
particular, however trifling, more difficult to please with
your own conduct, or do you go in all things with a looser
rein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any one?&rdquo; repeated Markheim, with an anguish of
consideration. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added, with despair, &ldquo;in none!
I have gone down in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;content yourself with what
you are, for you will never change; and the words of your
part on this stage are irrevocably written down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Markheim stood for a long while silent, and indeed it
was the visitor who first broke the silence. &ldquo;That being
so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall I show you the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And grace?&rdquo; cried Markheim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not tried it?&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Two
or three years ago, did I not see you on the platform of
revival meetings, and was not your voice the loudest in the
hymn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Markheim; &ldquo;and I see clearly what
remains for me by way of duty. I thank you for these
lessons from my soul; my eyes are opened, and I behold
myself at last for what I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, the sharp note of the door-bell rang
through the house; and the visitant, as though this were
some concerted signal for which he had been waiting,
changed at once in his demeanour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maid!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She has returned, as I forewarned
you, and there is now before you one more difficult
passage. Her master, you must say, is ill; you must let
her in, with an assured but rather serious countenance&mdash;no
smiles, no overacting, and I promise you success! Once
the girl within, and the door closed, the same dexterity that
has already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last
danger in your path. Thenceforward you have the whole
evening&mdash;the whole night, if needful&mdash;to ransack the
treasures of the house and to make good your safety. This
is help that comes to you with the mask of danger. Up!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
he cried; &ldquo;up, friend; your life hangs trembling in the
scales: up, and act!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Markheim steadily regarded his counsellor. &ldquo;If I be
condemned to evil acts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is still one door of
freedom open&mdash;I can cease from action. If my life be an
ill thing, I can lay it down. Though I be, as you say truly,
at the beck of every small temptation, I can yet, by one
decisive gesture, place myself beyond the reach of all. My
love of good is damned to barrenness; it may, and let it be!
But I have still my hatred of evil; and from that, to your
galling disappointment, you shall see that I can draw both
energy and courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful
and lovely change: they brightened and softened with a
tender triumph, and, even as they brightened, faded and
dislimned. But Markheim did not pause to watch or
understand the transformation. He opened the door and
went downstairs very slowly, thinking to himself. His past
went soberly before him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and
strenuous like a dream, random as chance-medley&mdash;a scene
of defeat. Life, as he thus reviewed it, tempted him no
longer; but on the farther side he perceived a quiet haven
for his bark. He paused in the passage, and looked into
the shop, where the candle still burned by the dead body.
It was strangely silent. Thoughts of the dealer swarmed
into his mind, as he stood gazing. And then the bell once
more broke out into impatient clamour.</p>

<p>He confronted the maid upon the threshold with something
like a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go for the police,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;I have
killed your master.&rdquo;</p>
